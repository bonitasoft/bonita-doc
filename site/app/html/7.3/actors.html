<h1>1.5.5 Actors</h1>
<p>There are two stages to specifying who performs a step in a
process:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the process is designed, the business analyst designates
an actor for the step. An actor is a placeholder that defines
the theoretical user who will perform the step.</li>
<li>Before a process is deployed, the actors are mapped to the
real users in an organization.</li>

<h2>Defining an actor</h2>
<p>When you define a process, you define who will carry out a step in
the process by specifying an actor. For example, if a step can be
done by any member of the HR team, you could call the actor hr, or
if a step can only be done by the sales team manager in Europe, you
could call the actor sales_mgr_europe.</p>
<p>Typically, an actor is defined for each step in a process, but you
can also specify an actor for all steps in a pool or lane. You can
also use an actor filter to specify the logical relationships
between actors. For example, in a process to request vacation days,
the request step can be carried out by any user, but the approval
step must be carried out by the manager of the requesting user.</p>
<p>You can define an actor at pool, lane, or step, and the definitions
are related. You must define actors in the order pool, lane, step.</p>
<p>To define actors for a process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define the actors for the pool:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the  pool and go to the <strong>Details</strong> panel, <strong>General</strong>
tab, <strong>Actors</strong> pane. If you have already defined any actors, they
are shown in the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong>. A new row is added to the table, with a temporary
name for the new actor (for example, Actor1). To change the
name, select it and type the name you want to use. You can
also add a description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat step 2 to add all the actors required for the
process. You can also remove an actor, by selecting it and
clicking <strong><em>Remove</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the actor that will be the initiator of the process
cases, and click <strong><em>Set as initiator</em></strong>. If you
do not define an initiator for the pool, the process cannot be started
in Bonita BPM Portal. Instead, it will have to be started programmatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each lane, define the actor. You can either select an
actor that was defined for the pool, by selecting the actor from
the drop-down list, or you can use an <a href="#Using_an_actor_filter">actor filter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each step, define the actor. You can use the actor defined
for the lane, or specify an actor for the step. To specify an
actor for the step, you can either select an actor that was
defined for the pool, by selecting the actor from the drop-down
list, or you can use an <a href="#Using_an_actor_filter">actor
filter</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>See <a href="/custom-user-information-bonita-bpm-portal.md">Custom user information in Bonita BPM Portal</a></p>
<h2>Setting the initiator</h2>
<p>The initiator is the user who starts a process instance. For a process that is started by a person, you must specify at least one actor to be the initiator. Any user who maps
to this actor can then start a process instance. If a process is started automatically (for example on a schedule), it is not necessary to designate an initiator.</p>
<h2>Using an actor filter</h2>
<p>To specify an actor filter, click <strong><em>Set...</em></strong>, choose one of the
predefined actor filters from the list, and follow the
instructions in the wizard to configure the actor selector.</p>
<p>To change the configuration of an actor filter, select the actor
filter, click <strong><em>Edit...</em></strong> and modify the information using the wizard.</p>
<p>To delete an actor filter, select the actor filter and click the
Erase icon. Note that this does not remove the actor filter from
the list of predefined actor filters, just from the process
definition.</p>
<p>For information about creating a new actor filter, see
<a href="/creating-actor-filter.md">Creating an actor filter</a>.</p>
<h2>Mapping an actor</h2>
<p>Before a process can be tested, you must map the actors in the process to
users in the organization. Before you can do this, you must
<a href="/organization-management-bonita-bpm-studio.md">define
your organization Bonita BPM Studio</a> and upload it to Bonita BPM Portal.</p>
<p>To map the process actors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the process diagram in Bonita BPM Studio, and click <strong>Configure</strong>
in the cool bar. The actor mapping dialog is displayed, and
indicates any actors in the process that are not yet mapped.</li>
<li>For each unmapped actor, click the actor name to select it.
You can then map it to a group, role, membership (that is, a
role within a group), or specific user.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you deploy a process, if you have the same organization definition in Bonita BPM Studio and Bonita BPM Portal,
you can map the actors first in Bonita BPM Studio then include the mappings when you build the process for deployment.
Otherwise, you can configure the actor mappings in Bonita BPM Portal after the process is deployed, when you resolve the process.</p>
<h2>Updating task assignment dynamically</h2>
<p>The Bonita BPM Engine API contains a method to re-evaluate the assignment of a task by reapplying the actor mapping any actor filters.
This means that if there are changes in your organization, you can update any active process instances to assign tasks to the correct people.
This is known as <a href="/manage-users#get_eligible">dynamic task assignment</a>.</p>
<h2>Export or import</h2>
<p>actor mapping</p>
<p>When you have mapped the actors for a process, you can export the
mapping as a file. The exported file is in XML. To export the
mapping as a file, open the process diagram in Bonita BPM Studio,
click <strong><em>Configure</em></strong> in the cool bar, and select <strong>Actor mapping</strong>. The
actor mapping dialog is displayed. Click <strong><em>Export actor mapping as
file...</em></strong> and specify the name and location of the file to be
created.</p>
<p>You can also import an actor mapping file that was exported from
Bonita BPM Studio. To import a mapping file, open the process diagram
in Bonita BPM Studio, click <strong><em>Configure</em></strong> in the cool bar, and select
<strong>Actor mapping</strong>. The actor mapping dialog is displayed. Click <strong><em>Import
actor mapping file...</em></strong> and specify the name and location of the
file to be imported. <em>Warning</em>: When the actor mapping information is
imported, it overrides the existing mappings defined for the
process.</p>
