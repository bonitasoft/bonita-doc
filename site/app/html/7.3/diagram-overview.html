<h1>1.5 Diagram overview</h1>
<p>A diagram is the visual representation of a group of related processes. It contains one or more pools.
Each pool contains a process. One diagram can therefore contain several processes.</p>
<p>A diagram has a name and a version number. You can <a href="bonita-bpm-studio-hints-and-tips.md#name">change the diagram name</a>
and you can <a href="bonita-bpm-studio-hints-and-tips.md#name">update the version number</a> whenever you want to indicate
a major change in the diagram. A pool also has a version number that can be updated manually.
There is no link between the diagram version and the pool version.</p>
<h3>How to create a new diagram</h3>
<p>To create a new diagram in Bonita BPM Studio, choose <strong>New</strong> from the <strong>Diagram</strong> menu or the Cool bar, or click
<strong><em>New Diagram</em></strong> on the Welcome page. Give your diagram a name, and optionally set the version number and add a description.
You can also turn on or off validation of your diagram. If validation is on, any errors in your diagram structure
are flagged with a red x icon. This helps you correct errors as you build your diagram, instead of correcting them
all at the end.</p>
<p>To open an existing diagram, choose <strong>Open</strong> from the <strong>Diagram</strong> menu or the Cool bar, click <strong><em>Open a Diagram</em></strong> on the Welcome page,
or double-click the diagram name in the <strong>Recently Modified</strong> list on the Welcome page.</p>
<p>The Diagram menu contains options for saving a diagram. You can also duplicate a diagram, which is a useful way of making
a backup copy of a diagram before you make major changes.</p>
