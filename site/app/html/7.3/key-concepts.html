<h1>1.2.2 Key concepts</h1>
<p>This page introduces some of the key concepts related to designing an application or
process with Bonita BPM, and the terminology used in Bonita BPM Studio.</p>

<h2>Applications and processes</h2>
<p>An application is a collection of processes, user interfaces (called pages) and shared data. A page that is a user interface to a process is called a form.</p>
<p>You can use Bonita BPM to create a process-based application or a process that is accessed only through Bonita BPM Portal. A process that is in an application is also visible in the Portal.</p>
<h2>Process definition</h2>
<p>A process is a sequence of tasks performed by people (human tasks) or automatically
(service tasks). The sequence has a start and an end, and can contain decision points, known as
gateways. A process definition is constructed in Bonita BPM Studio as a flow diagram. You add data, gateways, connectors, scripts and
expressions to control the process flow, and configure the process components and dependencies. The diagram
uses the Business Process Model and Notation, which is the standard for defining a business
process. Version 2.0, BPMN 2.0, was published in January 2011.</p>
<p>If a process is visible to users, you can use the UI designer to design forms
to input data and forms to display information.
The result is a process that can be deployed to Bonita BPM Portal.</p>
<h2>Business data</h2>
<p>A business application exists to support a business goal, either a specific goal related to your business, such as parts reordering in a manufacturing plant, or
a generic goal, such as improving efficiency through an automated expense reporting system. The key data in any application or process is business data. Because this
data is probably used by more than one process, Bonita BPM can access it in an external data source, so you do not need to copy or duplicate the data. Some
processes also manipulate data that is only useful within the process itself;
Bonita BPM stores this in its local database or in memory.</p>
<h2>Business Data Modelling</h2>
<p>Bonita BPM supports modelling and persistence of business objects that applications and processes interact with.
Such data can either be automatically stored in a database dedicated to business data, or can reside in existing information system databases, in which case the interaction is by connector.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Your organization is the set of all the users who play a part in all the applications and processes that
your business uses. The organization is stored in Bonita BPM Engine and can be managed in Bonita BPM Portal.
You can also create the organization in Bonita BPM Studio or by synchronizing with an external LDAP directory.
Typically, the organization corresponds to the hierarchy of teams within your business.
If your clients and suppliers have access to your processes, those users must also be included in the organization.
See the <a href="organization-overview.md">Organization overview</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Connectors</h2>
<p>A connector is a link between a process and an external information system
such as a database or information service. A number of standard connectors are
provided, and you can create additional connectors if required. Separating the
connector configuration and implementation from the process means it is easier
to update or replace the connector without having to modify the process. You can
also use the same connector in more than one process.
See the <a href="connectivity-overview.md">Connectivity overview</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Actors</h2>
<p>An actor is a placeholder specified in the process definition for the users. Using an actor instead of specifying
real people directly makes the process definition more flexible: when the list of users
changes, you change only the process configuration, which can be done
while the process is running. You can also use the same process definition with
completely different sets of users, for example, if a service business sells a
process to several clients. Making the connection between the actor definition
and the set of users is called actor mapping. See
<a href="organization-management-in-bonita-bpm-studio.md">Configure a test organization</a>
and <a href="actors.md">actors</a> for
details.</p>
<h2>Environments and parameters</h2>
<p>An environment (available in the Bonita BPM Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions) is the context in
which a process will run. There are three standard environments, Local,
Qualification, and Production. You can define additional environments that are
useful when designing and deploying a process for your business. A parameter is
a piece of information in a process that has a value specific to the
environment. See <a href="environments.md">Environments</a>
and <a href="parameters.md">Parameters</a> for more details.</p>
