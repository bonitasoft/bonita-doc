==== Methods

The methods used for this resource are:

* POST - Add a new subtask
* GET - Read or search a subtask
* PUT - Execute the subtask

==== Add a new subtask

Use a POST method to create a new subtask. A subtask is attached to a parent task and it needs to be immediately assigned to a user.

Example:

* *URL* +
`/API/bpm/manualTask`
* *Method* +
`POST`
* *Request Payload* +
_Example_: Add a new subtask to the parent task with id 1. The subtask has displayName "My subtask" , is assigned to user 1, and contains other important information.

==== Retrieve a subtask

Use a GET method to retrieve information about a subtask.

* *URL* +
`/API/bpm/manualTask/:manualTaskId`
* *Method* +
`GET`
* *Success Response*
 ** *Code*: 200

==== Search subtasks

Use a GET method with filters and search terms to search for subtasks.

* *URL* +
`/API/bpm/manualTask`
* *Method* +
`GET`
* *Data Params* +
xref:rest-api-overview.adoc#resource_search[Standard search parameters] are available. +
You can filter on:
 ** `+assigned_id={user_id}+`: retrieve only the manual tasks assigned to the specified user. For example, retrieve the manual tasks assigned to user with id 1: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=assigned_id%3d1`.
 ** `state=skipped | ready | completed | failed` : retrieve only the manual tasks with the specified state. For example, retrieve the ready tasks: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=state%3dready`.
 ** `+caseId={case_id}+`: retrieve only the manual tasks created in the specified case. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the case_id 2: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=caseId%3d2`.
 ** `+parentTaskId={parentTask_id}+`: retrieve only the manual tasks for a specific parentTask. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the parentTask_id 40001: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=parentTaskId%3d40001`.

+
You can search on:
 ** name: search all manual tasks with a name that starts with the search string. For example, search for all manual tasks that have a name that starts with MySubTask: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&s=MySubTask`.
