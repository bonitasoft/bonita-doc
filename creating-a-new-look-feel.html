	<h1>3.10.2 Creating a new Look </h1>
    <p>A Look &amp; Feel is defined in a set of files. You can set the Look &amp; Feel for the Bonita BPM Portal Web interface, an application, a custom page, or for the Bonita BPM Portal Mobile interface. </p>

<p>
<a href="#web">Bonita BPM Portal Web default Look &amp; Feel</a><br><a href="#mobile">Bonita BPM Portal Mobile default Look &amp; Feel</a><br><a href="#migration">Recommendation: Form footers</a>
</p>

<p>This page explains how to modify the Look &amp; Feel of Bonita BPM Portal and of forms in processes run from the Portal. You can also <a href="/specify-look-and-feel-0">specify the Look &amp; Feel of a web application in Bonita BPM Studio</a>. 
The definition in the Portal overrides the definition created in Studio. </p>

<p>To create a new Look &amp; Feel in Bonita BPM Portal, <a href="/managing-look-feel-0#export_default">export the default Look &amp; Feel</a> and modify the relevant components. 
You can either edit the files directly, or you can use a plugin and update the Look &amp; Feel in a browser. 
When the new Look &amp; Feel is ready, <a href="/managing-look-feel-0#import">import and apply the new Look &amp; Feel</a>.</p>

<p>There are two types of page in the Portal: pages developed with GWT, as in earlier versions, and new pages, such as the Case monitoring page, that have been developed using Angular. 
The two types of page have different mechanisms for defining Look &amp; Feel.
    This means that in some cases, you might need to specify a Look &amp; Feel element in two places to get a consistent look for your Portal and custom pages.
</p>

<p>For GWT pages, the most critical file in the Look &amp; Feel definition is <code>skin/skin.config.less</code> file. 
Any change you make to this file is automatically implemented in all the pages of the Portal or forms that do not use the Bootstrap Look &amp; Feel, so this is where we recommend that you make all changes, if possible. 
For example: </p>

<ul><li>To change the color of the menu bar, edit <code>skin/skin.config.less</code> and update the setting of <code>@mainAccentColor</code> to replace the default red (#b20706;) with the hexadecimal code for your preferred color. 
As an example, this file contains a line that you can uncomment to set the color to blue.</li>

<li>To change the font, edit <code>skin/skin.config.less</code> and update the setting of <code>@skinFont</code> to specify the font you want to use.</li>

<li>To replace the BonitaSoft logo with your own logo, create a transparent .PNG file with your logo and put it in the <code>skin/images</code> directory. 
Then edit <code>skin/skin.config.less</code>, and replace <code>logo.png</code> with your logo file. If your logo is not the same size as the default BonitaSoft logo, edit the <code>loginPage-logo-width:</code>
   and <code>loginPage-logo-height:</code> properties and specify the correct width and height.</li>
</ul><p>For pages developed in Angular, the Look &amp; Feel is defined using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. To modify the Look &amp; Feel, update the skin definition in  
 <code>skin\bootstrap\portal</code> for Portal pages or in <code>skin\bootstrap\applications </code> for applications.</p>


<p>There are five key files that must be present in the zip archive when you import a Look &amp; Feel:</p>
<ul><li><code>BonitaConsole.html</code>: HTML entry page for Bonita BPM Portal. If you want to add a custom JavaScript or custom CSS, modify this file and add it to the header.</li>
 <li><code>BonitaForm.html</code>: 	HTML entry page for forms in Bonita BPM Portal. If you want to add a custom JavaScript or custom CSS, modify this file and add it to the header.</li>
 <li><code>main.less</code>: 		Used to compile the LESS files into the CSS used for the GWT pages in the Portal. You must not rename this file, and we recommend that you do not change it.</li>
  <li><code>skin\bootstrap\applications\main.less</code>:       Used to compile the LESS files into the CSS used for applications. </li>
 <li><code>skin\bootstrap\portal\main.less</code>:	Used to compile the LESS files into the CSS used for Portal pages developed in Angular.</li>
 </ul><p>If you change any other file, you must test that the change has the required effect.</p>

 
<p>If you have applied a custom Look &amp; Feel in an earlier version, when you migrate to this version, the Look &amp; Feel is automatically migrated to the new structure for both GWT and Angular pages. 
If you want to see how your custom Look &amp; Feel is defined in this version, export the Look &amp; Feel before and after migration and compare the zip files.</p>


<p>Note: To provide you the best flexibility and adaptability, we do not run any security tests on the imported Look &amp; Feel theme, so you must make sure that you
do not upload any malicious or vulnerable code. If you wish to learn more about web security and the most common web vulnerabilities, see the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="migration">Recommendation: Form footers</h2>

<p>There are sometimes problems with the appearance of form footers after migration. If this is the case, update the <code>moredetails.less</code> file of the Look &amp; Feel to include the following definition:</p>

<code type="java">
#formframe, .forms-view, .forms-view .frame {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}

.forms-view .toolbar {
  margin: 30px 0 40px 0;
  padding: 0 35px 0 40px;
}

.forms-view .toolbar.empty {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.page_performTask .body, .page_StartProcess .body, .page_DisplayCaseForm .body {
  padding-bottom: 0 !important;
  margin-bottom: 0 !important;
  display: block !important;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</code>

<p>With this definition, the form footer is displayed instead of the Portal footer, and the form's iframe is now contained in a table row. This is recommended for easier maintenance and to avoid issues at future migrations.</p>
