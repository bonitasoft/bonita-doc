<h1>Graphical query builder</h1>
<p>The graphical query builder helps you configure a database connector by showing you the structure of database content to help you construct the database query.</p>
<h2>Connect to the database</h2>
<p>In the Database access information screen, check <strong>Use the graphical query builder</strong> and click <strong><em>Connect</em></strong>.<br>
In the popup, enter the information needed to connect to the database. A popup tells you when the connection is established.<br>
The graphical query builder connects to a database and retrieves information that you can use to construct the query graphically.<br>
The first time you provide the connection information, it is for the connection used by the graphical query builder.<br>
Subsequently, you may be asked to give the connection information again: this is to configure the connector for the running process.<br>
It is possible to use one database with the graphical query builder and a different database when running the process, provided that the structure of the data in the two databases is the same.</p>
<p>When the database access information is configured, click <strong><em>Next</em></strong> to go to the graphical query builder.</p>
<h2>Build a query</h2>
<p>With the graphical query builder you can construct a select, update, insert, or delete query.<br>
At any point, you can switch from the graphical query builder to entering the SQL query directly, by clicking on the <strong>Query</strong> tab.<br>
From the <strong>Query</strong> tab, you can go back to the graphical view by clicking on the <strong>Designer</strong> tab.</p>
<h3>Create a select query</h3>
<p>Use a select query to get information out of the database. To define a select query:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the table, by clicking <strong><em>Add a table...</em></strong> and selecting the table from the list in the popup. The query builder shows the columns of the database table.</li>
<li>Check the column or columns from which you want to retrieve the values.</li>
<li>If you want to ignore duplicate values and retrieve only the distinct values, check the <strong>DISTINCT</strong> box.</li>
<li>Optionally, set a condition on the values to be retrieved.
If you do not set a condition, you will get all the values from the selected columns (with or without duplicates, depending on the DISTINCT setting).<br>
Setting a condition is a way of choosing the rows from which you want to get the value from the specified column.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also specify groups to group the selected values, and group conditions to filter the results based on the value of a database element.</p>
<h3>Create an update query</h3>
<p>An update query modifies a value in the database. To define an update query:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the table, by clicking <strong><em>Add a table...</em></strong> and selecting the table from the list in the popup. The query builder shows the columns of the database table.</li>
<li>Check the column or columns where you want to update the values.</li>
<li>Optionally, go to the <strong>Where</strong> tab and specify a condition to identify the specific row to be updated.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Set</strong> tab and specify how the identified value is to be updated:</li>
<li>In the left-hand list, select the item to be updated.</li>
<li>Click the right-arrow to move it to the <strong>Update Column</strong> list.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Expression</strong> column, specify the new value for the item.
This can be a constant entered directly, the value of a field, or the value of a process variable.<br>
You can also specify DEFAULT to set the value to the default defined in the database.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create an insert query</h3>
<p>An insert query adds a new entry to the database. To define an insert query:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the table, by clicking <strong><em>Add a table...</em></strong> and selecting the table from the list in the popup. The query builder shows the columns of the database table.</li>
<li>Check the column or columns to include in the new entry. They are added to the <strong>Column</strong> column in the table. The default value, if one is defined, is shown in the <strong>Value</strong> column.<br>
In the <strong>Value</strong> column, specify the value to be added for each item. A value can be specified directly as a constant, or can be a process variable or a field value.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a Delete query</h3>
<p>A delete query removes an entry from the database. To define a delete query:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the table, by clicking <strong><em>Add a table...</em></strong> and selecting the table from the list in the popup. The query builder shows the columns of the database table.</li>
<li>Specify a condition to identify the entry or entries to be deleted:</li>
<li>In the <strong>Column</strong> column, specify the column name. This can be specified directly, or can be a field value or a variable.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Operator</strong> column, choose the logical operator.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Value</strong> column, specify the value as a constant, field value, or variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can combine conditions by specifying AND or OR operators in the last column of the table.</p>
