<h1>Talend TIS Job launcher</h1>
<p>The Talend TIS Job launcher connector enables you to launch a Talend Integration Suite (TIS) job.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Talend Integration Suite (TIS) to provide an integrated view of data from many data sources and a process updates one of those data sources, you could trigger a job to update the view.</p>
<p>The job is defined in TIS and specified by the id that was set when the job is created.</p>
<p>You cannot pass data through the connector to the job, and the connector does not return any output.</p>
<p>To configure the Talend TIS Job launcher connector, follow the steps in the wizard. To configure the job use the information below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>WSDL URL</td>
<td>The URL of the TIS project, specified in webservice description language</td>
<td>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Login</td>
<td>The login of the job owner</td>
<td>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The password of the job owner</td>
<td>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task id</td>
<td>The id of the task to launch. The id is defined in TIS when the job is created</td>

<p>When the connector runs in a process instance, it triggers the specified job in your TIS system.</p>
