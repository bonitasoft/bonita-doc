<h2>Bonita BPM Studio embedded Tomcat configuration</h2>
<h3>Default configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Embedded Tomcat listens on the following ports:
<ul>
<li>8080: HTTP. This value can be modified using Bonita BPM Studio preferences (see above).</li>
<li>8006: shutdown.</li>
<li>8009: AJP.</li>
<li>9091: embedded h2 database server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bonita BPM Studio also uses the following port:
<ul>
<li>6969: watchdog</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the configuration</h3>
<p>You might need to edit the Tomcat configuration files for example to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="logging.md">Configure logging</a></li>
<li>Change listening ports (shutdown, AJP, h2) to prevent conflicts</li>
<li>Declare a datasource to connect to a business database</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tomcat configuration files are located in the Bonita BPM Studio <code>workspace/tomcat/conf</code> folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>To change a port number, edit <code>server.xml</code>.</li>
<li>To add a data source, edit <code>context.xml</code> or <code>workspace/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/bonita.xml</code>.</li>
</ul>
