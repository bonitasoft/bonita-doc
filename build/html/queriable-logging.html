<h1>Queriable logger</h1>
<p>This page describes the queriable logger service.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The queriable logger service provides information about important events in the Bonita BPM Platform that are not directly related to execution of a process. The log includes information about administration operations such as deployment of a new process definition, commands, reporting, actor mapping, Portal Look &amp; Feel themes, and organization and user management.</p>
<p>The Bonita BPM Engine stores information in the queriable log. The information in the log is accessible using the <a href="javadoc.md">LogAPI</a>
(Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions only).</p>
<p>The information available from the queriable log is primarily for the platform and process administrator. It is not intended to be used as a notification system: avoid pooling on the queriable log. If you need to be notified of specific events, use the configurable event service.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to search for log message about a specific activity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">final SearchOptionsBuilder builder = new SearchOptionsBuilder(0, 100);
builder.filter(LogSearchDescriptor.ACTION_SCOPE, aTaskId);
builder.searchTerm(&quot;Adding a new user&quot;);
builder.sort(LogSearchDescriptor.ACTION_TYPE, Order.ASC);
final LogAPI logAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getLogAPI(session);
final SearchResult&lt;Log&gt; searchedLogs = logAPI.searchLogs(builder.done());
for (Log log : searchedLogs.getResult()) {
     // Print the detailed user creation message:
System.out.println(log.getMessage());
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The queriable logger service stores log message in the Bonita BPM Engine back-end database using the Hibernate library. The <a href="https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine/blob/master/services/bonita-log/bonita-log-api/src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/engine/services/QueriableLoggerService.java">interface</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine/tree/master/services/bonita-log/bonita-log-impl/src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/engine/services/impl">implementation</a> of the service are available from the source code repository on <a href="https://github.com/bonitasoft/">GitHub</a>.</p>
