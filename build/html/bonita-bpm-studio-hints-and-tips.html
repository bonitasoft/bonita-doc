<h1>Bonita BPM Studio hints and tips</h1>
<p>This page contains some information about smart ways to use Bonita BPM Studio.</p>
<h2>Adding items to a diagram</h2>
<p>There are several ways to add an item to the diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click-and-hold on a icon in the <strong>BPMN elements</strong> menu and drag it to where you want the item in the whiteboard.</li>
<li>Click-and-release on an icon in the <strong>BPMN elements</strong> then click where you want it to appear in the whiteboard.</li>
<li>Select the previous item in the flow, and drag the item from the context menu to where you want it in the whiteboard.</li>
<li>Copy and paste an item from another pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of selecting items from the <strong>BPMN elements</strong> menu is that you can choose precisely the item you want.<br>
The advantage of using the content menu is that the transition is automatically created.</p>
<p>If you add an icon to the diagram over a transition, the transition will be broken into two parts and the new item inserted between them. This is called <em>break-and-insert</em>, and can be used with any BPMN flow element except text annotations. You can also use <em>break-and-insert</em> when moving an item to a different place in a pool, if the transitions can be resolved.</p>
<h2>Using the tree view and search</h2>
<p>The tree view shows all the information that is in a diagram, arranged in a hierarchical structure. It can be a useful way to see all the information related to a particular step or form, or to find where a specific item is configured. For example, you can see the step where a variable is defined without having to check all the steps.</p>
<p>To find a term in your diagram, go to the Tree View panel (by default, at the bottom-left of the screen), enter the term in the filter field and press return.<br>
The tree view is updated to show only the items that match the term.</p>
<h2>Changing the diagram name and version</h2>
<p>Click on the background (outside of a pool) and go to the <strong>Diagram tab</strong> in the <strong>Details panel</strong>. Click on <strong><em>Edit...</em></strong> then specify the new name and version number.</p>
<p>You can use the same dialog to change the name and version of any pools in the diagram.</p>
<h2>Changing the diagram appearance</h2>
<p>You can modify the appearance of an item in the diagram by selecting it and going to the <strong>Appearance tab</strong> in the <strong>Details panel</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to changing the appearance of individual items in the diagram, there are some tools that you can use to make the layout clearer, by selecting a group of items and making the vertical or horizontal alignment regular. If a diagram is being developed or maintained by more than one person, it is important to keep the layout clear, to prevent misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The alignment tools, and others, are accessed from the icons at the bottom-left of the whiteboard.</p>
<h2>Open a recently modified diagram</h2>
<p>To see a list of recently modified diagrams without having to go to the Welcome page, go to the <strong>Diagram</strong> menu and choose <strong>Recently modified</strong>.<br>
A submenu of the last ten diagrams you have modified is displayed. Click the <em><strong>name</strong></em> of a diagram to open it.</p>
