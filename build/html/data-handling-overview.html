<h1>Data handling overview</h1>
<p>In a BPM-based application, use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="define-and-deploy-the-bdm.md">Business variables</a> for information that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is mostly used by Bonita BPM</li>
<li>has meaning after a process instance is archived</li>
<li>is used at several places in the process</li>
<li>is read by a process to orientate its flow</li>
<li>is shared across several process instances</li>
<li>is displayed in an application page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task-level <a href="specify-data-in-a-process-definition.md">process variables</a> for</p>
<ul>
<li>intermediate computation results (for example a connector result to be used as input of the next connector)</li>
<li>information that is private to the process, not used elsewhere in the application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pool-level <a href="specify-data-in-a-process-definition.md">process variables</a> for information that</p>
<ul>
<li>can be read by the process to orientate its flow</li>
<li>can be used at several places in the process</li>
<li>is private to the process, not used elsewhere in the application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>External databases, with <a href="connectivity-overview.md">connectors</a> and <a href="create-a-complex-data-type.md">custom data types</a>, for information that</p>
<ul>
<li>is used by multiple applications besides Bonita BPM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key benefits of using business data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control of indexing strategy</li>
<li>Definition of custom queries to efficiently read the data</li>
<li>Full control of lifecycle of the data through the set of processes that handle it (add, update and delete)</li>
<li>Improved performance compared with process variables or external databases</li>
<li>Easier application maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>An application page accesses business data using the <a href="bdm-api.md">bdm REST API</a>. A page also contains page <a href="variables.md">variables</a>, which have no meaning outside the page.</p>
<p>The data that is passed from a form to a process is defined using a <a href="contracts-and-contexts.md">contract</a>. Define a contract for process instantiation and for each human task.
These contracts are part of the process definition.
A form has access to business data and documents using the <a href="contracts-and-contexts.md">context</a> and the <a href="rest-api.md">REST API</a>.
A form also contains form <a href="variables.md">variables</a>, which have no meaning outside the form.</p>
