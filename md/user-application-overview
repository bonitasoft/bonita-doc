# Bonita User Application overview

This pages describes the Bonita User Application: its value, how to access it, its difference with the _User_ profile of Bonita Portal, and its pages. 

## Value
Bonita Portal is deprecated and will be removed in a future Bonita release.  
We believe that Bonita Applications give our users much more freedom for customization:
  * Their menus can be customized compared to provided Portal profiles by adding or removing pages
  * Because we are in the process of re-creating our Portal pages with the UI Designer, you will also be able to modify the pages to fit the precise users' needs.

The Bonita User Application allows anyone with the _User_ profile to interact with processes, cases, and tasks.

## Access
To get the application during Development, go to the "Resources" tile of the Studio Welcome page, and click on "Import Bonita User Application".
After validation, you can import the application and deploy it.

## Differences with _User_ profile of Bonita Portal
As we said just above, the main difference is that it is customizable.
As for the provided pages:
  * _Process page_ is the same than the [Portal process](user-process-list.md) page. It is made in _React_ and cannot be customized with the UI Designer yet.
  * _Case page_ has been recreated with the UI Designer so it has a few improvements and can be customized with the UI Designer.
  * _Task page_ is the same than the [Portal task](user-task-list.md) page. It is made in AngularJS and cannot be customized with the UI Designer yet.

## The User Case page
It has been created using our [R&D best practices](read the article), with repeatable containers.
