<h1 id="monitoring">3.3.5 Monitoring</h1>
<p>Monitoring gives information relative to a process.</p>
<p>This is only available to the Administrator and Process Manager profile.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Process management &gt; Monitoring</strong> for Administrator and <strong>Monitoring</strong> for Process Manager.</p>
<p>The <strong>Monitor open cases</strong> page is displayed, with the following summary information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of cases with failure</li>
<li>Number of healthy cases</li>
<li>Number of open cases</li>
<li>A table of open cases</li>
</ul>
<p>You can filter the table to show only a specified process, or process and version. You can also filter it by case state.</p>
<p>Process Manager users can see only the processes they manage.</p>
<p>From a row in the table, you can click the list icon to see a list of cases of the process. You can also open a diagram of a process, by clicking on the picture icon for the process. On the diagram, you can see that number and state of cases in progress at each step. Click <strong><em>Show key</em></strong> to see an explanation of the display.</p>
<p>The process diagram is constructed from the deployed process definition. This means that some details visible in Bonita BPM Studio, such as comments, are not available.</p>
<p>Note: if a process was deployed from a bar file created in Bonita BPM Studio 6.3 or earlier, the diagram display is not available. This is because some details of the <code>.bar</code> structure have changed. To see the diagram for such a process, export the process definition from Bonita BPM Studio 6.3 as a <code>.bos</code> file, import it into Bonita BPM Studio 6.4 or later, generate a new <code>.bar</code> file, and deploy it.</p>
