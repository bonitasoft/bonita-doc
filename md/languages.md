Instructions below explain how to add a language to Bonita BPM Portal. Steps below involve using content created by Bonitasoft community and therefore not officially supported.

1. Go to [Bonita BPM translation project](http://translate.bonitasoft.org/).
1. Select the language you are interested in.
1. Make sure you click on the "Toggle Hidden Files" button ![Toggle hidden files button](images/crowdin_toggle_hidden_files.png) to see already fully translated files.
1. Browse the file tree to `${varVersion}.x/bonita-web/portal` folder.
1. For each file in the folder: open it and in the **_File_** menu click on **_Download_**. Each `.po/.pot` file has a language indicator and a locale indicator. For example, the files for the Brazilian Portuguese language end with `pt_BR.po`.
1. For Subscription editions, you also need to get the files from `${varVersion}.x/bonita-web-sp/portal` folder.
1. Copy all the `.po/.pot` files to a new folder of your choice, preferably in a sub-folder inside your bundle. E.g. `[TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER]/i18n/`. For Bonita BPM Studio, Tomcat installation folder is located in `workspace/tomcat`.
1. Declare a new JVM property "org.bonitasoft.i18n.folder" and set the value to the full path to `i18n` folder:
    * For Tomcat embedded in Bonita BPM Studio edit the appropriate **.ini** file (e.g. **BonitaBPMCommunity64.ini** for Windows 64bit) and use the following syntax: `-Dtomcat.extra.params="-Dorg.bonitasoft.i18n.folder=C:\path\to_i18n\folder"`
    * For Tomcat on Windows edit **setenv.bat**
    * For Tomcat on Linux edit **setenv.sh**
    * For WildFly on Windows edit **standalone.conf.bat**
    * For WildFly on Linux edit **standalone.conf**
1. Restart your application server (or restart Bonita BPM Studio). The next time Bonita BPM Portal starts, it will detect the new language and add it to the list in the **Settings** menu.
