# 3 Bonita BPM Portal interface overview

### The User interface

The User interface is divided into 3 main columns: left, middle and right.

The left column is for filters, the middle column for bulk actions and right column for actions and more details about the selected item.

### Default profiles

There are three default profiles available in the Portal: **User**, **Administrator**, and (in the Efficiency and Performance editions) **Process manager**. 

The **Administrator profile** is responsible for the administration of the Portal and particularly for the management of the Processes, the organization, the reports, the custom profiles and the Look & Feel. 
(See example of the Administrator interface).

The **Process manager profile** shares responsibility for management of Processes that are assigned.

The **User profile** is responsible for performing the tasks for which they are a candidate and also for starting new cases of the Processes to which they have access.(See example of the User interface).

### Access to menus

Each profile has access to a diferent set of drop down menus, containing filters and action buttons corresponding to their user rights.

Note: A user with an admin profile has to be created by the technical user in order to manage the organization and other users. See [First steps after setup/Create an Administrator user](first-steps-after-setup.md).
