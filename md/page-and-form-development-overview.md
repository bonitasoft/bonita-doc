# User Interfaces development overview

This page summarizes the User Interface resources needed to create an application with Bonita.  

Your process-based application can use [pages](pages-develoment.md) and [forms](forms-development.md) to show or collect information in a browser.  
The overall structure of the application and the display of graphical elements in handled by the [layout](layout-development.md).  
The look and feel of the application, layout, forms, and pages is handled by the [theme](theme-development.md).

All of these UI resources are linked to the application descriptor when the application is created.  
The following pages give more information on how to develop each of them.
