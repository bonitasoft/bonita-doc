## Data

### ActivityVariable

#### Description

This resource enables you to retrieve the value of a specific variable name for a specific case (or process instance). Only persistent variables are concerned by this resource, not transient variables.

#### Identifier

The ID of the activity variable (a long value).

#### Representation

```json
{ 
  "tenantId": "_The ID of the tenant where the current user is logged in (technical information)_",
  "tenantId_string": "_number (since 7.0.1)_",
  "id":_The identifier of the variable_",
  "id_string":"_number (since 7.0.1)_",
  "name": "_The name of the activity variable_",
  "description": "_The description of the variable, if any_",
  "transientData": "FALSE" _Always false (boolean)_",
  "className": "_The fully qualified class name of the variable type_",
  "containerId": "_The ID of the activity containing this variable (same as the one passed as parameter) if the variable is defined at activity level, or ID of the process instance if the variable is defined on the process_",
  "containerId_string": _"number" (since 7.0.1)_,
  "containerType": "ACTIVITY_INSTANCE" | "PROCESS_INSTANCE" _depending on whether the variable is defined at activity or process level._",
  "value": "_the value of this variable. The format of the value depends on the type of the variable_" 
}
 ```   

The string representation added in 7.0.1 for Long attributes is a workaround for the JavaScript integer spectrum issue.

<a name="upload_casedoc"/>
#### Add a document to a case

Use a POST method to add a document to a case. You can upload a document from the local file system or by URL. Specify the case id and the document name in the payload. 
The document description is optional: if you do not specify a description, the description in the response is empty. The response contains a version, which is managed automatically.
You cannot currently retrieve a specific version of a document, only the most recent version. To retrieve earlier versions of a caseDocument, use the archivedCaseDocument resource.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument`  
* **Method**  
  `POST`
* **Request Payload**  
  _Example 1_: Upload `doc.jpg` from the tenant temporary folder of the bonita home to case 1 with the display name "Doc 1" and renaming the file into "document\_1.jpg":
  ```json
  {
    "caseId": "1",
    "file": "doc.jpg",
    "name": "Doc 1",
    "fileName": "document_1.jpg",
    "description": "draft"
  }
  ```
  _Example 2_: Upload `train_receipt.png` from my cloud drive to case 1 with the name "Train receipt":
  ```json
  {
    "caseId" : "1",
    "url" : "http://cloud.storage.com/sites/chris/expenses/july_2014/train_receipt.png",
    "name" : "Train receipt"
  }
  ```
* **Success Response**  
  * **Code**: 200
  * **Payload**:  
    _Example 1_:  
    In this example, `isInternal` is set to `true` because the the document object contains the content directly.  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"3",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"application/octet-stream",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"true",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Doc 1",
      "fileName":"document_1.jpg",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"documentDownload?fileName=document_1.jpg&contentStorageId=4",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```
    _Example 2_:  
    In this example, `isInternal` is set to `false` because the document is specified by URL so the document object contains a reference to the content, not the content itself.  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"4",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"image/png",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"false",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Train receipt",
      "fileName":"train_receipt.png",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"http://cloud.storage.com/sites/chris/expenses/july_2014/train_receipt.png",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```

#### Get a document from a case

Use a GET method to get a document from a case. First you get the document information, then you download the content. 
To get the document information, specify the document id in the URL. The document id is created when you upload a document to a case. There is no payload.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument/:documentId``  
* **Method**  
  `GET`
* **Success Response**  
  The response includes the "url" to use to download the content. Call the documentDownload servlet with this URL: 
  `/portal/documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4`.
  * **Code**: 200
  * **Payload**:  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"3",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"application/octet-stream",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"true",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Doc 1",
      "fileName":"doc.jpg",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```

#### Update a document in a case

You update a document in a case by uploading a new version of the document using a PUT method. 
You can upload a document version from the local file system or by URL. 
The document name will be used in all the cases of the process, but the combination of case id and document name is unique.

In the URL, you specify to supply the document id. This is included in the response when you first [add a document to a case](#upload_casedoc).

The response to PUT methods is the same as for POST methods.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument/:documentId`
* **Method**  
  `PUT`
* **Data Params**  
* **Request Payload**  
  Example 1: Update the document ExpensesPolicy in case 1 by uploading `Expense policy rev2.pdf` from the tenant temporary folder of the bonita home. The document id, 17 in this example, is specified in the URL. The description is optional. The filename allows to rename the file into "revision2.pdf" Method
  ```json
  {
    "file" : "Expense policy rev2.pdf",
    "description" : "updated version of document"
    "fileName": "revision2.pdf",
  }
  ```
  Example 2: Update the document ExpensesPolicy in case 1 by uploading `Expense policy rev2.pdf` from my cloud drive. The document id is 17\.
  ```json
  {
    "url" : "http://cloud.storage.com/sites/chris/expenses/july_2014/Expense policy rev2.pdf"
  }
  ```
* **Success Response**  
  * **Code**: 200
 
#### Search for a document

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument`  
  _Example_:   
  Find all documents with a document name equal to doc1: `/API/bpm/caseDocument?p=0&c=10&f=name=doc1`  
  Find all documents with with any of the searchable fields starting with "doc". `/API/bpm/caseDocument?p=0&c=10&s=doc`
* **Method**  
  `GET`
* **Data Params**

  * `name="string"`: search for documents with names that contain _string_. 
    Depending on the setting for [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the name or the start of a word in the name.
  * `description="string"`: search for documents with descriptions that contain _string_. 
    Depending on the setting for [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the description or the start of a word in the description.
