#### Execute a subtask

Use a PUT method to execute a subtask. Executing a subtask basically means changing its state to completed and providing an executedBy value.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/manualTask/:manualTaskId`  
* **Method**  
  `PUT`
* **Request Payload**  
  ```json
  { 
    "state":"completed", 
    "executedBy":"1" 
  }
  ```
* **Success Response**  
  * **Code**: 200

#### Retrieve a subtask

Use a GET method to retrieve information about a subtask.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/manualTask/:manualTaskId`  
* **Method**  
  `GET`
* **Success Response**  
  * **Code**: 200

#### Search subtasks

Use a GET method with filters and search terms to search for subtasks.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/manualTask`  
* **Method**  
  `GET`
* **Data Params**  
  [Standard search parameters](rest-api-overview.md#resource_search) are available.  
  You can filter on:
  * `assigned_id={user_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks assigned to the specified user. For example, retrieve the manual tasks assigned to user with id 1: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=assigned_id%3d1`.
  * `state=skipped | ready | completed | failed` : retrieve only the manual tasks with the specified state. For example, retrieve the ready tasks: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=state%3dready`.
  * `caseId={case_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks created in the specified case. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the case\_id 2: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=caseId%3d2`.
  * `parentTaskId={parentTask_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks for a specific parentTask. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the parentTask\_id 40001: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=parentTaskId%3d40001`.

  You can search on:
  * name: search all manual tasks with a name that starts with the search string. For example, search for all manual tasks that have a name that starts with MySubTask: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&s=MySubTask`.
* **Success Response**  
  An array of manualTask objects

## Data

### ActivityVariable

#### Description

This resource enables you to retrieve the value of a specific variable name for a specific case (or process instance). Only persistent variables are concerned by this resource, not transient variables.

#### Identifier

The ID of the activity variable (a long value).

#### Representation

```json
{ 
  "tenantId": "The ID of the tenant where the current user is logged in (technical information)",
  "tenantId_string": "number (since 7.0.1)",
  "id":_The identifier of the variable",
  "id_string":"number (since 7.0.1)",
  "name": "The name of the activity variable",
  "description": "The description of the variable, if any",
  "transientData": "FALSE",  //Always false (boolean)
  "className": "The fully qualified class name of the variable type",
  "containerId": "The ID of the activity containing this variable (same as the one passed as parameter) if the variable is defined at activity level, or ID of the process instance if the variable is defined on the process",
  "containerId_string": "number" (since 7.0.1)_,
  "containerType": "ACTIVITY_INSTANCE" | "PROCESS_INSTANCE" _depending on whether the variable is defined at activity or process level.",
  "value": "the value of this variable. The format of the value depends on the type of the variable" 
}
 ```   

The string representation added in 7.0.1 for Long attributes is a workaround for the JavaScript integer spectrum issue.

<a id="upload_casedoc"/>

#### Add a document to a case

Use a POST method to add a document to a case. You can upload a document from the local file system or by URL. Specify the case id and the document name in the payload. 
The document description is optional: if you do not specify a description, the description in the response is empty. The response contains a version, which is managed automatically.
You cannot currently retrieve a specific version of a document, only the most recent version. To retrieve earlier versions of a caseDocument, use the archivedCaseDocument resource.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument`  
* **Method**  
  `POST`
* **Request Payload**  
  _Example 1_: Upload `doc.jpg` from the tenant temporary upload folder to case 1 with the display name "Doc 1" and renaming the file into "document\_1.jpg":
  ```json
  {
    "caseId": "1",
    "file": "doc.jpg",
    "name": "Doc 1",
    "fileName": "document_1.jpg",
    "description": "draft"
  }
  ```
  _Example 2_: Upload `train_receipt.png` from my cloud drive to case 1 with the name "Train receipt":
  ```json
  {
    "caseId" : "1",
    "url" : "http://cloud.storage.com/sites/chris/expenses/july_2014/train_receipt.png",
    "name" : "Train receipt"
  }
  ```
* **Success Response**  
  * **Code**: 200
  * **Payload**:  
    _Example 1_:  
    In this example, `isInternal` is set to `true` because the the document object contains the content directly.  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"3",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"application/octet-stream",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"true",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Doc 1",
      "fileName":"document_1.jpg",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"documentDownload?fileName=document_1.jpg&contentStorageId=4",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```
    _Example 2_:  
    In this example, `isInternal` is set to `false` because the document is specified by URL so the document object contains a reference to the content, not the content itself.  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"4",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"image/png",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"false",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Train receipt",
      "fileName":"train_receipt.png",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"http://cloud.storage.com/sites/chris/expenses/july_2014/train_receipt.png",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```

#### Get a document from a case

Use a GET method to get a document from a case. First you get the document information, then you download the content. 
To get the document information, specify the document id in the URL. The document id is created when you upload a document to a case. There is no payload.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument/:documentId``  
* **Method**  
  `GET`
* **Success Response**  
  The response includes the "url" to use to download the content. Call the documentDownload servlet with this URL: 
  `/portal/documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4`.
  * **Code**: 200
  * **Payload**:  
    ```json
    {
      "id":"3",
      "creationDate":"2014-10-09 16:45:36.658",
      "author":"1",
      "index":"-1",
      "contentMimetype":"application/octet-stream",
      "caseId":"1",
      "contentStorageId":"4",
      "isInternal":"true",
      "description":"draft,
      "name":"Doc 1",
      "fileName":"doc.jpg",
      "submittedBy":"1",
      "url":"documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4",
      "version":"1"
    }
    ```

#### Update a document in a case

You update a document in a case by uploading a new version of the document using a PUT method. 
You can upload a document version from the local file system or by URL. 
The document name will be used in all the cases of the process, but the combination of case id and document name is unique.

In the URL, you specify to supply the document id. This is included in the response when you first [add a document to a case](#upload_casedoc).

The response to PUT methods is the same as for POST methods.

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/caseDocument/:documentId`
* **Method**  
  `PUT`
* **Data Params**  
* **Request Payload**  
  Example 1: Update the document ExpensesPolicy in case 1 by uploading `Expense policy rev2.pdf` from the tenant temporary upload folder. The document id, 17 in this example, is specified in the URL. The description is optional. The filename allows to rename the file into "revision2.pdf" Method
  ```json
  {
    "file" : "Expense policy rev2.pdf",
    "description" : "updated version of document"
    "fileName": "revision2.pdf",
  }
  ```
  Example 2: Update the document ExpensesPolicy in case 1 by uploading `Expense policy rev2.pdf` from my cloud drive. The document id is 17\.
  ```json

#### Create a case

This way of creating a case using this method will only work for processes in which no contract is defined. To instantiate a process with a contract, check the [process instantiation resource documentation](#instantiate_process). 

* **URL**  
  `/API/bpm/case`  
* **Method**  
  `POST`
* **Request Payload**  
  The process definition id, in JSON

##### Create a case without variables
  ```json
  {
    "processDefinitionId":"5777042023671752656"
  }
  ```
##### Create a case with variables

::: danger
:fa-exclamation-triangle: **Warning:** The attribute "variables" on the request payload is used to initialize the process variables (not BDM variables).
If you want to initialize BDM variables at process instantiation, add a contract on the process and map BDM variables to the contract data.
See [Start a process using an instantiation contract](#start-a-process-using-an-instantiation-contract) for usage.
:::

  ```json
