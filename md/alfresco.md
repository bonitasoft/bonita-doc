# Alfresco

Bonita Studio contains connectors for Alfresco 3.4 and Alfresco 4.2\. For each version, there are the following connectors:

* Delete an item by ID (folder, file, etc)
* Delete folder by path (delete a folder and its contents)
* Create a folder by path
* Upload a file to a destination folder

Notes for using these connectors:

* **Warning:**
There is a conflict between libraries provided with the Alfresco connector and libraries provided by other connectors or the platform itself if you use a data of type Object.  
When you configure a process that uses the Alfresco connector, you must [manage the jar files](manage-jar-files.md).  
* To delete a folder, it must be empty.
* In the path, all parameters have to be [URL Encoded](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp). Spaces are not allowed. For example: `/User Homes/user` has to be written `/User%20Homes/user`.
