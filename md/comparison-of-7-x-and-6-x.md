| Workspace API | The Workspace API is provided to generate `.bar` files from the command line, ready for production. .bar files are for deployment only and cannot be read by the studio. .bos files are for Studio interchange only and cannot be deployed to production. Each file format is optimal in term of content and is optimized for the target use case                                                                                                            | The Workspace API retains its 6.x capabilities. Moreover, it can export forms that are mapped to process instantiations or tasks, and pages that are mapped to a case overview. It cannot export application pages that are not elements of a process. For this reason the Workspace API has been deprecated in 7.7.0, and is replaced by the _LA builder_ included in the tooling suite of [_Bonita Continuous Delivery_ add-on](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bcd/2.0/).

| Expression Editor            | This expression editor enables a developer to define a constant, an expression, a comparison or a Groovy script. Very often, there is no need to resort to a Groovy script, a constant, a comparison or an expression being enough. A number of predefined expressions are provided.  Convenience Groovy functions are provided to help write scripts more quickly. These functions provide simple access to frequently used information, such as information on the current user and the process initiator. It is now very easy to retrieve the manager or the email of the current user or the process initiator | No changes to the expression editor. It is not available from the UI designer.

| Dynamic reconfiguration              | The process configuration is defined in Bonita Studio. With the Enterprise or the Performance Edition, you can modify the configuration in Bonita Portal after the process is deployed. You can dynamically update the following configuration items: actor mapping (all editions), parameters (Enterprise or Performance edition), connector implementation (Enterprise or Performance edition), dependencies (Enterprise or Performance edition), actor filter replay by Java call (Enterprise or Performance edition) | New live update feature expands the dynamic reconfiguration to other editions and to other items. The following items can be updated "live": Groovy scripts (Efficiency, Performance and Enterprise editions), process forms (Efficiency, Performance and Enterprise editions), actor mapping (all editions), parameters (all editions), connector implementation (all editions), dependencies (all editions), actor filter replay by Java call (Enterprise or Performance edition). See [Live update](live-update.md) |
