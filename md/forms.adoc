= Forms

This page explains how to add a form resource to the Bonita BPM Portal and make it available to users. Form resources are intended for use in applications.

Pages are xref:resource-management.adoc[exported. imported, modified, and deleted] as resources in the Portal.

Form definition
// {.h2}

A form is a xref:pages.adoc[page] that belongs to a process. It could be a process instantiation form, a human task form, or an overview form. There are some extra things to consider when you are creating a form compared with an ordinary page, concerning how data is passed between the process instance and the form.

A xref:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[context] is the set of data provided by the process instance or task instance to the form.
There is no context for a process instantiation form.

A xref:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[contract] is the definition of that data that the form returns to the process instance. There is no contract for an overview form.

Three auto-generated forms are provided by default, for process instantiation, for human task execution, and for the case overview.

The process instantiation and step execution auto-generated forms are based on the relevant contract and they are a useful tool for testing and debugging your application.

The overview consists of three main sections:

* List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case.
* List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case.
* Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.

=== Application Theme access

If your forms is viewed in an application, you will have access facilities for xref:applications.adoc[the application theme].

The `Theme.css` is directly accessible by adding the following link in `index.html`: `<link href="../theme/theme.css" rel="stylesheet" />`
This link is already inserted in the forms you design with the UI Designer.

::: info
The `app` URL parameter is used to retrieve the current application related Theme.    +
The living application layout inject this `app` URL parameter in the targeted page/form URL, and the value is the application token.              +
If you create your own navigation link, you will need to include this `app` URL parameter in the forged form URL, in order to be able to benefit from the application theme.
:::

::: info
In the portal, the link `../theme/theme.css` will point the file `theme.css` from the portal theme. This portal forms theme is empty, and customizable to fit to the current portal theme.
