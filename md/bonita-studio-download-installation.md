- Windows: `C:\BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y.z`
- macOS: `/Applications/BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y.z`
- Linux: `/home/<username>/BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y.z`

## First Bonita Studio execution

At this stage Bonita Studio should be running on your computer. If not, you can manually start it by using the installed shortcut or by using the Bonita Studio executable file from the installation folder.

You should get the Bonita Studio welcome page:

::: info
When Bonita Studio starts, various tasks are executed in the background, such as the embedded Bonita test server startup (including Bonita Engine initialization), Bonita test organization deployment, and more.
This might take a while and may be why some features are not immediately available.
