# First steps after setup

This page explains the post-installation setup tasks that you must carry out.

## Check the installation

To verify that the installation was successful and the database is correctly configured, connect to Bonita BPM Portal.

In the URL field of your web browser, enter the local host address, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/bonita`.

**Note:** If the Bonita BPM Portal login page is not displayed, [empty your browser cache](http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache) and [cookies](http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cookies) and then reload the page.

At this stage no organization information is loaded: only the technical user account exists.

## Change the default credentials

As a security precaution, we **strongly recommend** that before you start your application server, you change the default username and password used for the platform administrator and for the default tenant administrator.

### Platform administrator

The username and password for the platform administrator are defined in the file [`bonita-platform-community-custom.properties`](BonitaBPM_platform_setup.md), by the following properties:

* `platformAdminUsername` defines the username (default `platformAdmin`)
* `platformAdminPassword` defines the password (default `platform`)

This password is used for platform-level administration tasks, such as creating a tenant.

### Tenant administrator

Each tenant has an administrator, with a tenant-specific username and password. The tenant administrator is also known as the tenant technical user.

When the platform is created, default values for the tenant administrator username and password are defined in the file [`bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties`](BonitaBPM_platform_setup.md), by the following properties:

* `userName` defines the username (default `install`)
* `userPassword` defines the password (default `install`)

When you create a tenant, the tenant administrator is created with the default username and password, unless you specify new values. 
Change these tenant-specific credentials for an existing tenant by updating the `userName` and `userPassword` properties in `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties`.

::: warning
For the default tenant, the tenant administrator username and password must also be defined in file [`platform-tenant-config.properties`](BonitaBPM_platform_setup.md), with exactly the same values that you set in `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties`. 
At platform creation, this file contains the default username and password for the default tenant.

## Review security

There are a number of ways you can improve the security of your platform. 
Review the [REST API authorization](rest-api-authorization.md) and the other features relating to [security and authentication](_security-and-authentication.md) that are available in Bonita BPM and in your operating system, and update your platform as required for your production environment. 
For example, most environments require a [password policy](enforce-password-policy.md).

## Create a Bonita BPM Portal administrator

Create a user with the "administrator" profile:

Note: do not create a user or an administrator with the same login and password as the technical users (platform and tenant)

1. Log in to Bonita BPM Portal as the technical user.   
**Note:** If your system is using single sign-on with CAS, you need to log in with the following URL: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/login.jsp?redirectUrl=portal/homepage`.
2. Create a user with the standard profile.
3. Go to **Organization** \> **Profiles**. Select "Administrator" profile.
4. Click on the "More" button (in the top right corner).
5. Under "Users mapping", click on "Add a user".
6. Select your user and click on the "Add" button. Log out as the Technical user and log back in as the newly created user with administrative rights.
7. Create [users with the standard profile](manage-a-user.md).
8. You can add newly created users to the "User" (standard) profile or to a custom profile.

If you already have a system that stores information about end users, you can use it to create user accounts in Bonita.

If you use an LDAP or Active Directory system, you can use the [LDAP synchronizer](ldap-synchronizer.md) tool to keep the Bonita BPM Portal organization synchronized with it.
