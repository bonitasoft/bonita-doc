# Log in and log out

This page explains how to log in and log out of the Bonita User Interfaces.  

Note: to avoid login problems, make sure you [empty your browser cache](http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache)

## Log in

A user may receive an email with a link to start a case or a task in Bonita Portal or an application. 
Or a user wants to check the status of the tasklist in Bonita Portal or business data and operations in a custom application.  
Or an administrator needs to perform monitoring or maintenance on the Bonita Platform.  
For any of this, they need to log in. To do so:

  1. Enter the login page url.
    * For Bonita Portal: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/`. The default port number is 8080\.  
    * For Bonita User Application: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/apps/userApp`.  
    * For Bonita Administrator Application: 
      * For the Enterprise edition: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/apps/adminAppSP`   
      * For the Community edition: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/apps/adminApp`  
    * For a custom application: `http://`_`hostname:port`_`/bonita/apps/yourAppName`.

  2. In the fields, enter the _username_, and the _password_
  3. Click on the **Login** button.

The default Portal profile is User. From there, the user can [navigate](navigation.md) to their other profiles.   
Each application is mapped to one profile. A user can [navigate](navigation.md) between the applications they have the permissions to access.
