# Configure an email connector

In order for a process to interact with external systems such as publishing a document on a CMS, calling a REST API, or sending an email, Bonita provides connectors. In our example we will configure an email connector to notify the manager that a task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ requires their attention.

::: info
A connector is a piece of code that is executed when starting or finishing a process or a task. It will process input data (for example business variable values) and generate (optionally) some outputs. Connector code might only transform inputs but can also perform interaction with external systems.

In order to avoid settings that are specific to real email provider, we will use a tool for a fake email server "FakeSMTP":

1. Download FakeSMTP from this link: <http://nilhcem.github.com/FakeSMTP/downloads/fakeSMTP-latest.zip>
2. Unzip the file
3. Run FakeSMTP by double-clicking on the JAR file, or by running this shell command: `java -jar fakeSMTP-2.0.jar`
4. When the user interface is displayed, set the **listening port** to _2525_
5. Click on the **Start server** button.

Now that we have a fake server running, let's configure the email connector on the _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ task:

1. Select the task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_
2. Go to **Execution > Connectors in**
3. Click on the **Add...** button
4. Select the _Email (SMTP)_ connector
5. Click on the **Next** button
6. Name the connector configuration _Send notification_
7. Click on the **Next** button
8. Set the following parameter values:
   - SMTP host: _localhost_
   - SMTP port: _2525_ (the port number specified in FakeSMTP)
   - SSL (in the **Security** section): _unchecked_
9. Click on the **Next** button
10. Enter [\_no-reply@acme.com\_](mailto:_no-reply@acme.com_) in the **From** field
11. Use the ![pencil icon](images/getting-started-tutorial/configure-email-connector/pencil.png) icon to edit the expression of the **To** field
12. Set the **Expression type** to **Script**
13. Paste the following Groovy script into the code editing zone: `BonitaUsers.getProcessInstanceInitiatorProfessionalContactInfo(apiAccessor,processInstanceId).email`
14. Click on the **OK** button
15. Click on the **Next** button
16. Set _You have a pending task_ as the subject
17. Click on **Finish**

If you run the process with the connector configured, you should see a new incoming email in the FakeSMTP user interface when task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ becomes available.

You have now a process definition that uses a wide range of Bonita features. In the next chapters, we will create an application on top of this process.
