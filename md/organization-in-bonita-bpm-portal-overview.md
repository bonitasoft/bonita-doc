# Organization Management

In Bonita Portal as in Bonita Administrator Application, a user with the _Administrator_ profile can view all the entities of the deployed organization.

In practice, this includes:
* the parent groups
* child groups
* the number and list of users in a group
* the roles and the number of users with that role
* personal and professional data about the user
* Custom User Information on users
* the date and time of the user's last login

The Administrator has the rights to:
* [install an organization exported from Bonita Studio](import-export-an-organization.md)
* [export an organization from Bonita Portal](import-export-an-organization.md)
* create, update, and delete groups, for [Bonita Portal](group.md) or the [Administrator application](admin-application-groups-list.md)
* create, update, and delete roles, for [Bonita Portal](role.md) or the [Administrator application](admin-application-roles-list.md)
* create, update, and manage users and manage memberships, for [Bonita Portal](manage-a-user.md) or the [Administrator application](admin-application-users-list)

When you first launch Bonita Portal or the Bonita Administrator Application in a Production environment, there is **no default organization**.
You must [create a user with the Administrator profile](first-steps-after-setup.md). This user can than create and manage the organization.
