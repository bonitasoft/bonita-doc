This page describes the queriable logger service.

## Purpose

The queriable logger service provides information about important events in the Bonita Platform that are not directly related to execution of a process. The log includes information about administration operations such as deployment of a new process definition, commands, reporting, actor mapping, Portal Look & Feel themes, and organization and user management.

The Bonita Engine stores information in the queriable log. The information in the log is accessible using the [LogAPI](http://documentation.bonitasoft.com/javadoc/api/${varVersion}/index.html)
(Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions only).

The information available from the queriable log is primarily for the platform and process administrator. It is not intended to be used as a notification system: avoid pooling on the queriable log. If you need to be notified of specific events, use the configurable event service.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to search for log message about a specific activity:
```groovy
final SearchOptionsBuilder builder = new SearchOptionsBuilder(0, 100);
builder.filter(LogSearchDescriptor.ACTION_SCOPE, aTaskId);
builder.searchTerm("Adding a new user");
builder.sort(LogSearchDescriptor.ACTION_TYPE, Order.ASC);
final LogAPI logAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getLogAPI(session);
final SearchResult<Log> searchedLogs = logAPI.searchLogs(builder.done());
for (Log log : searchedLogs.getResult()) {
     // Print the detailed user creation message:
System.out.println(log.getMessage());
}
```

## Implementation details

The queriable logger service stores log message in the Bonita Engine back-end database using the Hibernate library. The [interface](https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine/blob/master/services/bonita-log/bonita-log-api/src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/engine/services/QueriableLoggerService.java) and the [implementation](https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine/tree/master/services/bonita-log/bonita-log-impl/src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/engine/services/impl) of the service are available from the source code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/bonitasoft/).
