# Case overview page

This page is related to a case, open or archived. It gives a real-time summary of the case to both users and administrators.
A default overview page is provided in Bonita BPM Portal.
This overview page consists of three main sections:
* List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case in real time: if after a case is archived, other processes edit the business data used in the case, the current values of those business data are displayed.
* List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case, in real time too.
* Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.

It is used in the user task list, as the 3rd tab of the details pane on the right.
And for all profiles, it is also available by navigating from the case list page: on a given case row, click on the "eye" icon.

**Note:** We strongly recommend to change the case overview page before going into production, to adapt its content to the users' needs.

To create your own, you can use the UI Designer following two different flows:
 - The first time you create a case overview page:
   - Go to Bonita BPM Studio and select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Make sure the "UI Designer" option is selected
   - Click on the pencil icon right by the input field.
   This will open the UI Designer and automatically map the overview page to the pool.

 - When the page is created and you want to map it to other pools:
   - In the diagram, select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Click on the drop down menu arrow
   - Select the page name
   This will create the mapping between the overview page to the pool.


As it is linked to the process, the case overview page designed using UI Designer, belongs to the .bar file (unlike other pages).

But you can also use your favorite editor and build your own overview page.
In this case, when your page is ready:
  - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
  - Select the **External URL** option
  - Type the page URL.

If you don't want to offer case summary to users or administrators, select the "No form" option in the studio.

::: info
**Note:** The customization of the default case overview page is only possible using **Performance** and **Efficiency** edition,
as it is based on [live update](live-update.md) feature.
:::

Because of its link to the process, in Bonita BPM Performance and Efficiency editions, the process administrator can also update it at runtime.
To know more about the live update feature, go to [live update](live-update.md).

this feature allows you to customize the default case overview page.
To customize this page, log into Bonita BPM Portal as an Administrator, then go to the **Resources** menu > **Pages** section.
Select **Autogenerated Case Overview** and export it to open it in your favorite editor. For now, it cannot be edited in the UI Designer.
Once the customized case overview page is finished, use the [live update](live-update.md) feature to set the new process over view page.
