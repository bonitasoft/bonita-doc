# Case overview page

## Overview

The _case overview_ page is related to a case, open or archived. It gives a real-time summary of the case to both users and administrators.  
For all profiles, it is available by navigating from the case list page: on a given case row, click on the "eye" icon.  
Since 7.3.0, it is also used in the user task list, as the details pane 3rd tab.  

A default _case overview_ page is provided in Bonita BPM Portal. It consists of three main sections:
* List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case in real time: if after a case is archived, other processes edit the business data used in the case, the current values of those business data are displayed.
* List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case, in real time too.
* Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.  

There is something tricky to understand about the _case overivew_ page: 
 - Because it doesn't require information from the end-user, the _case overview_ is by nature a page (it displays information).
 - Because it is linked to a process definition, it is technically considered as a form. 
 <!-- undergoing discussion to debate what we should recommend: ceate form or page in the UI Deisgner for example -->

Therefore, the default, auto-generated _case overview_ page is considered as a "form" in Bonita BPM, and is part of the .bar file of the diagram, ready to be deployed in the Portal.

**Note:** We strongly recommend to change the _case overview_ page before going into production, to adapt its content to the users' needs.

## Create a _case overview_ page

To create your own, you can use the UI Designer following two different flows:
 - The first time you create a _case overview_ page:
   - Go to Bonita BPM Studio and select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Make sure the "UI Designer" option is selected
   - Click on the pencil icon right by the input field.
   This will open the UI Designer and automatically map the overview page to the pool.

 - When the page is created and you want to map it to other pools:
   - In the diagram, select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Click on the drop down menu arrow
   - Select the page name
   This will create the mapping between the _case overview_ page to the pool.

As it is linked to the process, the _case overview_ page designed using UI Designer, belongs to the .bar file (unlike other pages).

But you can also use your favorite editor and build your own _case overview_ page.
In this case, when your page is ready:
  - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
  - Select the **External URL** option
  - Type the page URL.

If you don't want to offer case summary to users or administrators, select the "No form" option in Bonita BPM Studio.

## Customize the default _case overview_ page

::: info
**Note:** This feature is only available in Bonita BPM **Performance** and **Efficiency** editions.
:::

So, to customize the auto-generated _case overview_ page, log into Bonita BPM Portal as an Administrator, then go to the **Resources** menu > **Forms** section.
Select **Autogenerated Case Overview** and export it to open it in your favorite editor. For now, it cannot be edited in the UI Designer.
Once the customized _case overview_ page is finished, use the [live update](live-update.md) feature to set the new _case overview_ page.
