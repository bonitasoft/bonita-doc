# Case overview page

This page is related to a case, open or archived. It gives a real-time summary of the case to both users and administrators.
A default overview page is provided in Bonita BPM Portal.
This overview page consists of three main sections:
* List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case in real time: if after a case is archived, other processes edit the business data used in the case, the current values of those business data are displayed.
* List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case, in real time too.
* Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.

It is used in the user task list, as the 3rd tab of the details pane on the right.
And for all profiles, it is also available by navigating from the case list page: on a given case row, click on the "eye" icon.

**Note:** We strongly recommend that you edit the case overview page before going into production, to adapt its content to the users' needs.
To do so, you can either customize the default one, or create your own.
:::

To customize the default case overview page, log into Bonita BPM Portal as an Administrator, then go to the **Resources** menu > **Pages** section.
Select **Autogenerated Case Overview** and export it to open it in your favorite editor. For now, it cannot be edited in the UI Designer.

To create your own, you can use the UI Designer following two different flows:
 - The first time you create a case overview page:
   - Go to Bonita BPM Studio and select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Make sure the "UI Designer" option is selected
   - Click on the pencil icon right by the input field.
   This will open the UI Designer and automatically map the overview page to the pool.

 - When the page is created and you want to map it to other pools:
   - In the diagram, select the pool
   - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
   - Click on the drop down menu arrow
   - Select the page name
   This will create the mapping between the overview page to the pool.

You can also use your favorite editor and follow instructions in [pages](pages.md#custom_pages) to create a custom page.
<!-- The following text is written below the field of the "External URL" option. Does this apply to overview page? "The processInstanceID is provided in the query string. It is the valued o f the parameter <id> that is added to the external URL when redirecting. Other REST API resouerces are available for filling in the page with values, notably a "context" (API/bpm/case/<processInstanceId>/context and API/bpm/archivedCase/<archiveProcessInstanceID>/context) including business data and document references." -->

When your page is ready:
 - Go to the **Execution** tab, **Overview page** pane
 - Select the **External URL** option
 - Type the page URL.
 <!-- What if the page is under "Resources" in the Portal? What is its URL? -->

If you don't want to offer case summary to users or administrators, select the "No form" option.
   <!-- See BS-15600 to rename this option into "No page".-->

As it is linked to the process, the case overview page belongs to the .bar file, unlike other pages.

<!-- What happens for called processes? (=> don't forget to do it also for called processes?) -->

Because of its link to the process, in Bonita BPM Performance and Efficiency editions, the process administrator can also update it at runtime.
