# User list in Bonita Administrator Application

This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile in Bonita Administrator Application can see and do about the users of the deployed organization.

Here is a view of this page:
![Administrator user list Portal](images/UI2021.1/admin-application-users-list.png)<!--{.img-responsive}-->

## View user's detailed information
In the user list, the Administrator can view the users currently active in the deployed organization.  
By clicking in the _Inactive_ radio button, they can also access the users who have been deactivated. "Inactive" means that they can no longer log in Bonita Portal nor any Bonita application.
To view the user's detailed information:
1. Go to _Organization_/_Users_
2. In the row of the user, click on the _View user details_ icon
3. Click on the sections in the menu on the left to read all the user's detailed information

## Live Update
The Administrator can [Live Update](live-update.md) a user:
 * create
 * deactivate
 * edit information
 * edit memberships
 * edit profiles
 
Live updating is only in case of an issue to solve temporarily. We strongly encourage the modification of the organization to be conducted 
in Bonita Studio so it can be shared and versioned with the whole project, or through the [LDAP synchronizer](ldap-synchronizer.md) if the organization is located in an external system.

To map a user to a profile:
1. Go to _Organization_/_Profiles_
2. In the row of a profile, click on the _Show mapping with organization_ icon
3. In the "Mapping with Users" section, click on the _Edit user mapping_ icon
