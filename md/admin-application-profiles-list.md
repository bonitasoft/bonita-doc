# Profiles management in Bonita Administration Application

This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile can do with profiles in the Bonita Administrator Application. 

In all Bonita editions, Administrators can change the mapping between a provided profile (User and Administrator) and the organization entities (user, groups, roles, and memberships).  
In Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, there is one more provided profile: Process Manager.
In Enterprise, Performance, and Efficiency editions, Administrators can also create new profiles and edit them.

Here is a view of this page:

## View profile and profile mappings
In _Organization_/_Profiles_, the list shows all profiles sorted by alphabetical order:
- Three provided profiles: "User", "Administrator", and for Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions,"Process Manager"
  These profiles are marked in the list by a "Bonita" icon at the far right of the profile row. This means that they cannot be deleted nor renamed.
- All custom profiles created, for Enterprise, Performance, and Efficiency editions

To view the mapping of the profile with the entities of the organization, in the row of the profile, click on the _Show mapping with organization_ icon.  

## Export a profile
It may happen that the Administrator needs to export a profile, to reimport it in a Bonita Studio or install it on another Bonita Administrator Application.
To do so:
1. Go to _Organization_>_Profiles_
1. In the row of the profile to export, click on the _Export profile_ icon
1. Confirm the exportation in the file browser


## Live Update
The Administrator can [Live Update](live-update.md) a profile:
 * create a custom profile (not for Community or Teamwork)
 * delete a custom profile (same)
 * edit the name and description (only for custom profile)
 * edit the mapping (all editions, all profiles)
 
This is only in case of an issue to solve temporarily. We strongly encourage the modification of the organization and profiles to be conducted 
in Bonita Studio so it can be shared and versioned with the whole project, or through the [LDAP synchronizer](ldap-synchronizer.md) if the organization is located in an external system.
