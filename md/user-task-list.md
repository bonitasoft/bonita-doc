# User task list

This page explains what a user with the User profile in Bonita Portal or in the [Bonita User Application](user-application-overview.md) can see and do about tasks.  
_Users_ can view lists of tasks to do as a member of a team, view tasks precisely assigned to them, view tasks thay have done related to different processes, take and release tasks, and do tasks, eventually.

## Overview

Starting with Bonita 7.3, users benefit from a configurable task list, to manage tasks involving human actors from all processes in a more efficient fashion.
This page is also made available as a custom page in Bonita Portal > _Resources_, to be used in any [application](applications.md) or [custom profiles](custom-profiles.md), for users types of profiles.

Here are the values of the user task list:
  * Default Master/Detail design pattern, to view list and form in the same screen
  * _Panel expand_ feature, to display wide forms in a large modal window

  * List settings: number of tasks in a page, choice of columns, columns ordering
  * Easy access to case information, one tab away from the form. This case information is the case overview page, that the development team can customize
  * Easy access to case comments, also one tab away from the form or case information

  * Alternate "full width" list, with task information displayed in a large modal window

This list also leverages two legacy features (prior to Bonita 7.3.0):
  * [Dynamic task display name](optimize-user-tasklist.md), for efficient task identification (insert business values in task name)
  * [Word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md#word_based_search), for efficient task name search (search for any word in the task name)

The task list also contains a _Done tasks_ filter, for the user to check if the task has been completed properly.

::: info
A user with the _User_ profile, who is a manager, can see the _More..._ page for their team members' tasks, by specifying the task id.  
To do so, display any task in the Portal, then change the task id in the URL to the id of the task you want to see.

::: info
**Note:** Since Bonita 7.3.0, creating subtasks is no longer possible. However, if subtasks have been created in a process instance in an old Bonita version, and if the Bonita Platform has been migrated to a later version while the case was open, then the subtasks will still be visible to the users assigned, and users will still be able to complete them.
