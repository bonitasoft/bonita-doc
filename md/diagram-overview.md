# Diagram overview

A diagram is the visual representation of a group of related processes. It contains one or more pools.  
Each pool contains a process. One diagram can therefore contain several processes.

A diagram has a name and a version number. You can [change the diagram name](bonita-bpm-studio-hints-and-tips.md) and you can [update the version number](bonita-bpm-studio-hints-and-tips.md) whenever you want to indicate a major change in the diagram. A pool also has a version number that can be updated manually.   
There is no link between the diagram version and the pool version.

### How to create a new diagram

To create a new diagram in Bonita Studio, choose **New** from the **Diagram** menu or the Cool bar, or click **_New Diagram_** on the Welcome page. Give your diagram a name, and optionally set the version number and add a description.  
You can also turn on or off validation of your diagram. If validation is on, any errors in your diagram structure are flagged with a red x icon. This helps you correct errors as you build your diagram, instead of correcting them all at the end.

To open an existing diagram, choose **Open** from the **Diagram** menu or the Cool bar, click **_Open a Diagram_** on the Welcome page, 
or double-click the diagram name in the **Recently Modified** list on the Welcome page.

The Diagram menu contains options for saving a diagram. You can also duplicate a diagram, which is a useful way of making a backup copy of a diagram before you make major changes.
