The classes located in the `org.bonitasoft.console.common.server` have been removed. They have been deprecated since December 2015 as of Bonita 7.2.0

Replacements
- `org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.page.PageContext` by `org.bonitasoft.web.extension.page.PageContext`

An example of `PageController` migration is available in the [bonita-distrib github repository](https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-distrib/commit/f1f9d356c96d4e2807bd8b59376ce57d4af89b9a#diff-caa18f5f325ab429a66c76851e3bdd42)
