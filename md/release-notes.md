<a id="technology-updates"/>

## Technology updates
* support of Wildfly 10.1.0 application server replacing Jboss AS 7.1.1
* clustering: upgrade to Hazelcast 3.6.3 `(SP)`

## Limitations and known issues

* **MacOS Sierra (10.12)**: **Bonita BPM Studio** installed using zip package failed during launch. Bonita BPM can successfully be installed on **MacOS Sierra** using the `dmg` package
* **MacOS** environment: starting from **MacOS El Capitan 10.11.4** (March 2016), new security rules block the launch of **Bonita BPM Studio**. You must temporarily remove security on `App` launching in _System Preferencesâ†’Security & Confidentiality_.
* 6.x legacy forms: There might be some graphical issues (CSS) when displaying 6.x forms in the right panel of the new user tasklist. Use preferably the expended mode (full page list + popup for the form) or modify the portal look & feel in order to add a min-width to the from container in BonitaForm.html 
* Default applications layout is not compatible with new task list custom page
* Having executed a task in a subprocess, I cannot see the overview of the root process instance
