:::

## New values added

### Business Data Model editor
BDM and access control editors have been reworked, in order to improve your experience and your efficiency.

### Generate project documentation
For Teamwork, Efficiency, Performace and Enterprise editions only.
Extract informations from a project sources to generate an asciidoc document. The generation templates can be customized to suit your needs. More details [here](project-documentation-generation.md).


## Improvements

### Development suite changes

#### Increase the default value of the development runtime's maximum memory heap size to 1Gb (512Mo previously)

To avoid memory issues with large bar files deployment the default xmx value has been increased to 1Gb. If you want to revert this change, you can change it in the Studio preferences -> Server settings -> Tomcat Maximum memory allocation.

#### UIPath connector: Cloud support
The UIPath connector now supports the cloud solution.

### Collaboration - Select the branches to clone
When cloning a project, gain time by selecting the branches you want to clone instead cloning all the branches


## Technical updates

## Feature deprecations and removals
### Deprecations

### Removals
### Complex data-types generation have been removed

This feature was used to generate Java POJOs and XSD in Subscription editions. It is recommend to add your own Java model as jar file in the project classpath or create your [data model using Groovy objects](groovy-in-bonita.md#create-data-model).

## Bug fixes

## Runtime changes

### lib upgrade
- spring, spring-boot
- hibernate 4 to 5
- ...


## Bundle changes

Upgrade Tomcat from 8.5.47 to 8.5.50 (tomcat-dbcp from 9.0.16 to 9.0.30) **subject to change prior GA**


### Tomcat Manager removal

- the Tomcat Manager is no more provided
- the bundle is not intended to be used to deploy extra webapps
- alternatives exist to deploy extra webapps if still needed

### Tomcat root url redirected to Bonita

Simplify access to bonita by redirecting tomcat root to the bonita webapps.
For instance http://localhost:8080 redirected to http://localhost:8080/bonita

TODO: find other rationales

### Single Bonita log file

All logs are now generated by default in a single `bonita.log` file.

This fixes the following issues that occurred in previous Bonita versions
- empty log files as their related webapps are not packaged within the Bonita Bundle
- some logs related to Bonita activities (in particular, jdbc drivers logs) are generated in `catalina.log`. This was
fixed from version to version, but most of the time, this was done only after receiving external feedback on bug
investigations (information were lost or hidden in catalina log file).
- complex logging configuration to handle which logs are generated to which log file
- hard to follow `localhost` logs and Bonita logs


### Thread name in Bonita logs

**TODO**: improve wording + provide more info

As of Bonita 7.11, the thread name information is added in `bonita.log` (by default, right after the logger name).
This helps tracking the processing when parallel requests are in progress.
