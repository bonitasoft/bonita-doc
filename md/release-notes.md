# Release notes

Bonita BPM 7.4 includes a set of user-based product enhancements, bug fixes related to Bonita BPM Engine, 
a new REST connector and important technology updates.

## User-based product enhancements

<a id="bpm-studio"/>

### Bonita BPM Studio
* When importing a .bos file, 3 options are now available:
    * import it in the current repository
    * import it in another existing repository
    * create a new repository and import it there
  This may prevent from overriding a BDM file or other types of development artifacts.
* Contract inputs can be defined with the type LONG, at pool level only. In called processes, this is helpful to receive IDs from call activities
* The list of operations in a task and in the outputs of a connector configuration can be reordered
* Process simulation capability has been removed from the product `(removed)`

<a id="bdm-usability-improvements"/>

### Business Data Model (BDM)
* In the Studio, a new menu item Development > Business Data Model > Browse data (h2 console) opens the H2 console to visualize and browse business data. When testing a process, this helps to see how Business Objects instances evolve.
* In the Studio repository, .xml is now the storage format of the BDM. Using any Version Control System, you can now manually handle a _diff_ of 2 different revisions of the same BDM

<a id="uid-usability-improvements"/>

### UI Designer
* CSS, Javascript, and localization.json assets can be edited in line, directly in the UI Designer
* Variables can be sorted by names and types
* Variables search field sticks at the top of the pane, so you can scroll vertically and still see it
* When the "Preview" window is open and you click on "Preview" again, it is now reloaded, so only one window is open at a given time

<a id="task-and-case"/>

### Task & Case Management
* The estimated due date for a human task can be defined as an expression in the Studio
* A task can now be retrieved by its case ID in the user Portal task list
* In the user Portal case list, a new icon has been added at the end of each case row. It takes the user to the task list To do, filterd by the case ID.

### Connectivity
* A new REST connector has been added, to make REST calls (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to a third-party system `(new)`
* The CMIS connector has been improved, to retrieve a list of documents in a content management system (CMS), and to upload multiple documents to a CMS

<a id="csrf-security"/>

### Security
* CSRF security mechanism is now enabled by default when installing Bonita BPM, to protect the REST API against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Custom pages not developped with the UI Designer may need to be updated to comply with this new setting.

<a id="platform-installation"/>

### Platform installation
* The installation procedure of Bonita BPM bundles has been simplified, namely the database configuration part. Read the file HOW_TO_INSTALL_AND_RUN located in the bundles to learn more.


<a id="technology-updates"/>

## Technology updates in Bonita BPM 7.4.0
* Wildfly 10.1.0 application server replaced Jboss AS 7.1.1
* Hazelcast is updated to Hazlecast 3.6.5 `(SP)`, to improve clustering types of installation


## Limitations and known issues
* **MacOS Sierra (10.12)**: **Bonita BPM Studio** installed using the `zip` package fails during launch. Bonita BPM can successfully be installed on **MacOS Sierra** using the `dmg` package
* **MacOS** environment: starting from **MacOS El Capitan 10.11.4** (March 2016), new security rules block the launch of **Bonita BPM Studio**. You must temporarily remove security on `App` launching in _System Preferencesâ†’Security & Confidentiality_.
