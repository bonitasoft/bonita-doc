## New values added
### Development suite multi-maintenance version support
For a given minor version of the development suite (Studio and UI designer), you can now seamlessly work on projects that have a different maintenance version (but the same minor version).
For example: if your Studio is in version 7.12.4. You will be able to work on 7.12.2 or 7.12.5 projects without migrating the project or being blocked.

## Improvements

### Development suite changes
#### Warning before the migration when cloning a project
If you are cloning a repository branch that required migration then you will be informed of the need for migration before it is actually done. This allows you to cancel the operation and change the branch if needed.

#### Project Problem View and project validation
A new view is now available in the Studio to see all the project issues and warnings. It is also possible to validate a project through the contextual menu.

#### Dark mode theme for the Studio
In the "Appearance" section of the Studio settings, you can now change the theme. You have two possibility: light (default) and dark.
