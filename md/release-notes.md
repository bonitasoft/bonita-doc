## Living Application Development and Deployment

### Integration of SSO SAML 2.0
Bonita works with Single-Sign-On (SSO) solutions using SAML V2 protocol `(Teamwork, Efficiency, Performance edition)` : 
* Being able to use standard authentication service 
* Can connect to Bonita apps with my company credentials (per tenant configuration)
* Common SAML 2.0 Identity providers : ADFS (MS Active Directory Federation Services), SalesForce, Open AM, Google Auth,...

### New wizard to import a process in the studio & compare the artifacts 
Bonita Studio provides a wizard when importing a .bos that display the duplicate artifacts (forms, connectors, ...)  and ask for actions to the users. Usual actions are proposed to user for every artifacts : keep existing or overwrite with the new import :
* Ease collaboration between teams who works with .bos exchange
* Ease the collaboration by file exchange and reduce drastically the risk of overwrite error during import of a .bos.

### Industrialization of Living Application (in Studio)
In Bonita Studio, provide an editor to create the Living Application navigation without having to go on the Portal administration. This is the first step towards the full Application artifacts development into the Bonita Studio in future versions `(Efficiency, Performance edition)` :
* Create and edit Living Application navigation descriptor in Studio. 
* Construct application navigation from inside Studio based on existing artifacts.
* Store the descriptor in your VCS.
* Deploy on the local Portal to preview the Living Application and export for your production environment.

## UI personalization

### New management of date/time
New management of date and time to properly manage Living Applications used across multiple timezones. It now follows the philosophy of Java 8 date management :
* Benefit from the Java 8 improvement of date/time management in order to better manage timezones in UI (forms and pages). Ensure the use cases of : 
    * entering and display a birthdate (no timezone impact).
    * define and display meeting date and hour (timezone related).
    * define and display a flight arrival date (local timezone).
* Note this update does not change the way dates are displayed on the Bonita Portal.

### Link widget and preview improvement
The Link widget as been improved in order to support more use cases and it can now be tested in the preview in most cases. The improvements are:
* Addition of a new property to pass pass additional query parameters when creating a link to a form or a page
* Addition of a new property to pass the name of the target application (useful in the preview when you want to test a link to an application page or when you need to redirect to another application)
* The URL of the preview can be edited to pass additional parameters in the query string in web browsers supporting it (currently, only Firefox)

## Technology updates

### Full Java 8 support
Bonita is fully compatible with java 8 in production and development environment. It allows to write java 8 extension points (Connectors, Actor Filters, Custom Pages, ...). Java 8 syntax and specific APIs can now be fully used in all Bonita [extensions points](software-extensibility.md#stable_extension_points).
JRE or JDK 8+ is *required* to run. Bonita 7.5.0+ cannot be operated on Java 7 anymore.

### Support of Microsoft Edge
Bonita web tools and user interfaces are fully compatible with the Microsoft Edge and IE 11 browsers (UI Designer editor, All artifacts generated by UID (Forms, Pages, ...), Bonita Portal). 

### Removed support 
* Remove support for Oracle Weblogic application server
Bonita 7.5.0+ does not support Oracle Weblogic application server anymore.  
Refer to [full software requirements](hardware-and-software-requirements.md) for more details on supported environments.
* Remove support for Internet Explorer 9 and 10
Bonita 7.5.0+ does not support Internet Explorer 9 and 10 anymore.  
Refer to [full software requirements](hardware-and-software-requirements.md) for more details on supported environments.

### Other dependency updates
* hibernate is updated to 4.3.11, to support JPA 2.1 specification
* httpclient is updated to httpclient 4.5.2
* httpcore is updated to httpcore 4.4.4
* spring is updated to spring 4.3.7

### API removals

* Engine APIs have been cleaned up from some deprecated methods:
  * ProcessAPI.addComment() - replacement method is [ProcessAPI.addProcessComment()](http://documentation.bonitasoft.com/javadoc/api/${varVersion}/org/bonitasoft/engine/api/ProcessRuntimeAPI.html#addProcessComment-long-java.lang.String-)
  
## Breaking changes

### UI Designer

#### Ui-bootstrap.js library removed from runtime
In our first design iteration, forms, pages and layouts designed with the UI Designer embedded 
[UI Bootstrap js, version 0.13.4](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/versioned-docs/0.13.4/) by default and silently,
even when not needed. We have removed it so you can use it only when you need it, and with the version you choose. 

This will not affect any artifact that has been created with the UI Designer and is currently deployed in Bonita Platform.

Before this change, user could create custom widgets based on angular-bootstrap v0.13.0 without adding explicitly
angular-bootstrap has an asset and without declaring required modules.
Custom widgets that has been created this way (which is not the right way to go) will not work anymore and need to 
be changed to include angular-bootstrap has an asset and to declare the right required modules.
  
#### Forms, pages, layouts CSS cleaned
Default CSS file embedded in UI Designer artifacts (except custom widgets) has been cleaned. Indeed some of those CSS
rules were overall not used and clutter this file.
 
This will not affect any artifact that has been created with the UI Designer and is currently deployed in Bonita Platform.

Nevertheless some unwanted style could appear when importing a custom layout based on the default layout of Bonita < 7.5.0.
If you do so and observe that the layout menu does not fit the whole width of your page, you can bring back the default 
style by adding the following lines in `layout.css` file.
```css
.component .container {
     width: 100%;
 }
```
The most wanted choice would be to re-create the custom layout from Bonita 7.5.0+ default layout 

## Limitations and known issues
* **MacOS Sierra (10.12)**: **Bonita Studio** installed using the `zip` package fails during launch. Bonita can successfully be installed on **MacOS Sierra** using the `dmg` package
* **MacOS** environment: starting from **MacOS El Capitan 10.11.4** (March 2016), new security rules block the launch of **Bonita Studio**. You must temporarily remove security on `App` launching in _System Preferencesâ†’Security & Confidentiality_.
