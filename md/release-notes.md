## Feature removals

### Jasper 5 connector
Jasper connector has been removed from provided connectors in the Studio. If you have a process that depends on this connector and want to migrate in 7.7+, you have two options:
* Export the Jasper connector from a previous Studio version
* Download the connector from the [community website](https://community.bonitasoft.com/project/bonita-connector-jasper)
Then just import the connector using `Development > Connectors > Import connector...` menu.

### Deprecated Workspace API
The Workspace API tooling (headless studio build) has been deprecated. You are recommanded to use the *LA builder* which is part of the tooling suite of [Bonita Continuous Delivery add-on](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bcd/2.0/).
