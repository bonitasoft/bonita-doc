# Complex data types

If the standard data types are not suitable for a variable in your process, you can create a new custom complex data type. It is useful for example to reference data from an external database.

A complex data type is a collection of attributes, each attribute having a data type. Complex data types are defined in a JAR or XSD file. Each file can contain more than one definition. To add a new complex data type, create a new JAR or XSD file.

If you are using the Performance, Efficiency, or Teamwork edition, you can also use Bonita Studio to add a new data type:

1. From the **Development** menu, choose **Data types**, then choose **New data type...**. In the dialog box that opens, you can define a set of data types.
2. At the top of the dialog box, specify a name for the set of data types.
3. For each type, specify a name, and the set of attributes. Each attribute has a name, a type, and can be either single or multiple.
4. When you have defined all the data types required, click **_OK_**.
5. Click **_Create as JAR_** or **_Create as XSD_**, then click **_Finish_**.

When the new data type has been defined, as a JAR or XSD definition, it can be used to [define a variable](specify-data-in-a-process-definition.md).

Warning: Java data types (defined in a JAR file) use the STAX API. Stax libraries cannot be loaded in more than one classloader but must instead be placed in a single location where they can be called by all the items that use them. When you configure a process that uses Java data types, you must [manage the jar files](manage-jar-files.md).
