# Administrator Group list in Bonita Portal

This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile in Bonita Portal can see and do about groups in the organization.  
To easily manipulate users with the same rights, it is possible to group them together.  
Groups can be defined in the organization, attached to users and used to map actors.
