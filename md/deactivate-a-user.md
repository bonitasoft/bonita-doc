# User activation / deactivation

Activation / deactivation of a user allows to revoke any access to the platform without
deleting the user.

If a user is deactivated, the user cannot log in to Bonita Portal. However, all their past actions are kept
intact and can be displayed.

The Administrator cannot add a membership to a deactivated user.
