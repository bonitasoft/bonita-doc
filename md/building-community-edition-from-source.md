# Building Bonita BPM

In order to build Bonita BPM you need to use the script provided in [Build Bonita BPM](https://github.com/Bonitasoft-Community/Build-Bonita-BPM) GitHub project. Use the branch of the project that match the version you want to build.

Simply run `bash build-script-7.4.1.sh` and provide required information.

A script is used because some components rely on components that are built earlier in the sequence, so the build order must be respected.
