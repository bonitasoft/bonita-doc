:page-aliases: ROOT:create-application.adoc

The last step of this Getting Started tutorial is to create an application.

To create and deploy an application in your local environment, use the *xref:ROOT:applicationCreation.adoc[Application descriptor]*. This editor defines the skeleton of an application, as it contains references to resources installed in Bonita Portal and used by a given application. It will also help deploy the application directly from Bonita Studio.

The page you have created in the UI Designer, as well as the forms, have been automatically added to project resources under *Pages/Forms/Layout*.

To create the application, add a new application descriptor:

. In the Bonita Studio menu click on menu:Development[Application descriptors > New]
. A guidance pop-up appears. Click on *OK*
. Click on *Add a new application descriptor*. In the pop-up window, type _claims_ in the *Application Token* field, and _Claims_ as *Display name*.

The `applicationDescriptorFile.xml` is initialized and the editor will help you create the application directly from Bonita Studio.

To create an application, you have to define:

* The application token
* The application name
* Which profile will have access to the application
* The menu and pages of our application
* The homepage

. Click on the button *Add one-page menu* under *Navigation* section.
. Type _My dashboard_ in the column *Menu*
. Type the page name _claimsList_ in the column *Application page*
. Enter _dashboard_ in the column *Token*

[NOTE]
====

The look & feel can be fully customized by modifying the xref:ROOT:layouts.adoc[layout] and adding a custom xref:applications:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[theme].
====

The application is ready to be deployed in Bonita Applications. Now you need to deploy it in Bonita Applications:

. Click on the *Deploy* icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/create-application/deploy-icon.png[deploy icon]
. Click on *Select all* to make sure everything is deployed: test organization, business data model, process definition, application page
. Make sure that *Clean BDM database before deployment* is not checked as you want to keep your data for testing
. Click on *Deploy*
. In the *Deploy status* pop up window, click on *Close*
+

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first process and your first application with Bonita.

[NOTE]
====

Confirm that the application is available :

. Click on the Applications icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/create-application/applications-icon.png[Applications icon] in the Bonita Studio coolbar.
. You will see the application _Claims_ that you have just deployed listed in Bonita Application Directory. If you click on the URL, _My Dashboard_ page will be displayed in your browser.
