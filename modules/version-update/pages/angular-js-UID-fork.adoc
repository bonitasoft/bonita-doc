== AngularJs fork
As part of Bonitasoft's initiative to fix CVEs, an improvement was required in the UID Artifact builder.
The current AngularJs version used by this part of UID is 1.3, and a migration to a newer version is impossible because of the breaking changes that exist in version 1.4. +
Thus, the solution that was chosen is to fix those CVEs by cherry-picking them to AngularJs 1.3.
Currently, all work for this can be found in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/angular.js[angular.js forked github project]. +
A release of this project has been done and integrated in the UID Artifact builder.

=== https://security.snyk.io/vuln/npm:angular:20150807[CVE-2019-14863/CWE-78]: properly sanitize xlink:href attribute interpolation
When a xlink:href is used in a UID widget, angular does not do proper sanitization on the value of the html attribute, thus, any cross-site scripting (XSS) would get executed.
This is something that only affects UID custom widgets, since the default ones don't use this attribute. +
If your widget uses a xlink:href, then it will be properly sanitized by angular. +
This was cherry-picked from angular v1.5.0

=== https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-534884[CVE-2019-10768]: prototype pollution when using angular.merge
When using angular.merge, the JavaScript __proto__ object property of the destination object would get modified by the one in the source object
This behaviour only affects UID custom widgets, since we don't touch the object prototypes in the default UID widgets. +
If your widget did a merge on two objects, expecting a __proto__ to be applied to the destination that will have the same value as the one of the source object, then, this will not work anymore. +
A non-recommended solution would be to manually set the __proto__ property of the destination object to equal the one of the source object after the merge. +
This was cherry-picked from angular v1.7.9
