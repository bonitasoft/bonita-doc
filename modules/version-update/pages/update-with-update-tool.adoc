Guide on how to update Bonita Runtime main version (single or multiple nodes) using Bonita Update Tool.

[NOTE]
====

.*Updating* means moving from one Bonita version to a newer one, to benefit from:
* new features (in Main versions)
* technology updates (in Main versions)
* bug fixes (in Maintenance versions)
 
====

== Overview

This page explains how to update Bonita Runtime starting from version 7.10.0 till the latest available Bonita Runtime version.
Short procedure : Service stopped, update the data, install a new environment, test non-updated elements behavior and compatibility with new bonita version. 
Detailed version : xref:update-with-update-tool.adoc#updating-bonita-bundle-step-by-step-procedure[Updating Bonita bundle: step-by-step procedure]. 

There is only one version of Bonita Update Tool: Bonita Update Tool 3.x. 

== Pre-requisite

The Update Tool requires a Java 11 JRE

== How works Bonita Update Tool

_Bonita Update Tool_ contains a set of scripts that execute changes on the data for making it compatible with a newer main version of Bonita Runtime. 
The tool is provided as a zip archive that contains an executable script to determine your current version and to request the targeted main Bonita version for the update.

The update process is step-based, with each Bonita main version being equal to a step. +
The script manages the sequence of steps from your current version to the targeted main version and supports MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. There is no update for h2 database.

=== Can Bonita Update Tool be used to upgrade/downgrade between community and subscription?
The answer is *“NO”*. 
The Bonita Update Tool does not help you upgrade/downgrade between the community/subscription versions, so you cannot xref:ROOT:upgrade-from-community-to-a-subscription-edition.adoc[change edition] at the same time as updating.

=== Bonita Runtime version to target
Always update to the latest main release by using the Bonita Update Tool. Maintenance releases often contain bug fixes made shortly after the release of subsequent main releases.
____
*For example:* Bonita 7.13.2 contains fixes for certain bugs that were found earlier in the 7.13.x versions (like 7.13.0 and 7.13.1). To get all of those fixes, update to the 7.13.2 maintenance version instead of 7.13.1.

[#update]

=== Download
// add links to Bonita web site and Customer Service center => OK
Download the target Bonita version bundle and the adequate update tool for your Edition from the http://www.bonitasoft.com/downloads[Bonitasoft web site] for Bonita Community edition or from the https://customer.bonitasoft.com/download/request[Customer Service Center] for Bonita Subscription editions. You will also have to download a Tomcat server that matches the target Bonita Runtime version. 

=== Licenses
If you are running a Bonita Subscription edition, you need a valid license for your Bonita target version. 
If you are updating to a new maintenance version within the same main version, your license remains valid after the update. 


== Things to know before launching the update

[CAUTION]
====
.*Special attention required on:*
* *Custom reports :* Up to Bonita 2021.1 (Bonita Runtime 7.12) they may continue working, depending on the custom code you added. Starting with Bonita 2021.2 (Bonita Runtime 7.13), custom reports will not be supported in Bonita Runtime anymore. They have been replaced with a standalone Enterprise only - Reporting Application. 

// lien vers dynamic permissions => old module, new identity
* *Dynamic Permissions :* Starting from Bonita 2022.1, xref:ROOT:rest-api-authorization.adoc#dynamic-authorization-checking[Dynamic Permissions] are available only in Subscription edition. This means that for Community edition, the configuration files/folders remain available but the functionality will not work, without additional custom code or upgrade to Subscription edition. 
* Several bugs affect legacy Bonita versions by preventing a smooth Bonita Runtime update with BPM services paused when:
** The source version is older than Bonita 7.8.0, and the target version is between Bonita 7.8.0 and Bonita 7.11.5
** The source version is older than Bonita 7.10.5 and the target version is older than Bonita 2021.1
* Deployed process definitions: The processes will continue to run using the definition created in the previous Bonita version.
* If you have added custom indexes to certain tables in the Engine database, you must remove them before updating to a later version. If you do not remove these indexes, the update process will not complete.
* Process definition sources (.bos files) require a manual update. Update these by importing them into the new version of Bonita Studio.
====

.Before launching the update script, there are *manual activities* to be done: 
* Go through the release notes of all the versions till the one targeted for the update, for changes/deprecations/removals and see if they impact your existing developments.
____
*For example:* when updating from 7.10.y to 7.11.0, you will need to read all the release notes in between those versions.
____
// link to special cases and troubleshouting to be added => OK
* Go through the xref:update-with-update-tool.adoc#special-cases[Special cases] and xref:update-with-update-tool.adoc#troubleshooting[Troubleshooting] paragraphs below.

// link to setup tool to be added => old module, new runtime
* Secure the update by doing xref:#backups[backups]. Better safe than sorry.
* Check that the database version is up-to-date and supported by the new Bonita version.
* Runtime tomcat server custom configuration: You will need to re-apply your customizations after the update process finishes.
* Runtime setup folder custom configuration is kept in the database: Custom configurations made and pushed from the setup folder in the previous version are kept in the database. However, to benefit from the changes and improvements made in the product, you may want to compare the files you pull from your database and the target version files available in the setup/platform_conf/initial folder.
* Custom connectors, actor filers, data types, custom pages, RestAPI extensions: will for sure continue to work in the new version if no custom code has been added, default Bonita code. If you did add custom code, before starting the update, check in the release notes for any breaking changes and test them thoroughly after the update.

.Following elements will be updated *automatically* when launching the update script:
* Engine server
* Engine database (including all data on active and archived process instances) 
* Organization definition
* Log files from the previous versions will not be touched. A new dedicated folder for the target version will be created to store the log files. 
* Runtime data

When the script has finished executing, you will have to complete the update procedure by unzipping and configuring new bundle's version.

// add link to the paragraph => OK
Go through the paragraph xref:update-with-update-tool.adoc#updating-bonita-bundle-step-by-step-procedure[Updating Bonita bundle: step-by-step procedure] for step-by-step instructions.

=== BACKUPS 
==== Database files 
From database point of view, as any operation on a productive system, an update is not a zero-risk operation.
*Therefore, it is necessary to backup your database before launching the updating procedure.*

==== Configuration files 
As mentioned above, Runtime setup folder custom configuration made and pushed from the setup folder in the previous version will not be reseted to the default version in the database.

However, having a backup of your configuration files before launching the updating procedure is *HIGHLY* recommended, in case you need to merge custom properties and configurations to the target Bonita Runtime. Use the xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[platform setup tool] to pull the configuration from the database and save a backup of your setup folder after the pull:

There is below a Linux example:
[source,bash]
----
cd setup
./setup.sh pull
----

==== Look&Feel 
Starting with Bonita 2021.2 (Bonita Runtime 7.13), Bonita Applications replaced Bonita Portal. If you need to use some of the Portal Look&Feel assets in the themes of your applications, make sure you create backups of those files before launching the updating procedure.

=== JRE requirements
Based on your target Bonita version, check whether JRE update is required in your environment before launching the update process:  

|===
|*JRE version* |*Bonita version*
|JRE version 11 | If targeting an update from Bonita 2021.2 or greater
|===

For more info, see Support Guide and xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Supported Environment Matrix for Server].

[#rdbms_requirements]

=== Database
Generally, the update script supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

.Prior to running the Update tool, please: 
// link to database requirements => old module, new :runtime:
* Check the detailed xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[database requirements] to see if updating your database version is required or not.
____
// link to RDBMS customizations => old module, new runtime
If an update is required, make sure to apply all the xref:ROOT:database-configuration.adoc#customize-rdbms-to-make-it-work-with-bonita[RDBMS customizations] required by Bonita when setting up the new database version.
____
* If custom indexes have been added to certain tables in the engine database, they should be removed them before launching the update procedure. If not removed, the update procedure will not be completed.

NOTE: There is no update for H2 database.

=== Drivers 
Make sure you double-check that you use the official driver version that matches your database version. 
*Having the correct database driver is mandatory for a smooth update.*

// link to instructions for Oracle driver download => old module, new runtime
If you are using an Oracle database, please follow the instructions for xref:ROOT:database-configuration.adoc#jdbc-drivers[Oracle driver download].

// link to Oracle 12c (12.2.x.y) => OK
Particularly, if you use Oracle 12.2.0.x.y and are updating to Bonita 7.9.n or 7.10.n, then remove the existing ojdbc8-19.3.0.0.jar file, and add the specific JDBC driver to bonita-update/lib. If you use Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, add the JDBC driver for your database to bonita-update/lib. This is the same driver as you have installed in your web server lib directory. The driver for Oracle 19.3.0.0 is already embedded in bonita-update/lib. If the target version of the update is Bonita 7.9 or greater, you must upgrade to xref:update-with-update-tool.adoc#download-the-specific-jdbc-driver-for-the-oracle-12c-1220xy-or-19c-19300[Oracle 12c (12.2.x.y)].

=== Estimated required time 
WARNING: Bonita Runtime must be shut down during update activities.
The time required depends on several factors like your database volume, the gap between the source and the target version and your system configuration, hence it is difficult for Bonita to be precise about the required amount of time.
However, the following example can be used as a guide:

*From Bonita 7.13.3 to Bonita 7.14.0*
[cols=2]
|===
|*Criteria*
|*Data*
|Database entries

== Updating Bonita bundle: step-by-step procedure

image::ROOT:images/images-6_0/update_bigsteps.png[Update steps]

This section explains how to update a platform that uses one of the Bonita bundles.

First, download the target version bundle and Bonita Update Tool for your edition: 
* from the http://www.bonitasoft.com/downloads[Bonitasoft site] for Bonita Community edition
* from the https://customer.bonitasoft.com/download/request[Customer Service Center] for Bonita Subscription Pack editions

=== Database 

.The steps are as follow:
// add link to RDBMS requirements => old module, new runtime
[#rdbms_requirements]
. Check that your current RDBMS version is compliant with the versions supported by the targeted version of Bonita xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[(see RDBMS requirements)]
. Unzip the Bonita Update Tool zip file into a dedicated directory that can be called bonita-update. 
. Configure the database properties needed by the update script, by editing the *bonita-update/Config.properties* file with the following information:

|===
|*Property* |*Description* |*Example*
|db.vendor
|Database vendor
|postgres
|db.driverClass
|The driver used to access the database
|org.postgresql.Driver
|db.url
|The url of the Bonita Engine database
|jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bonita-update
|db.user
|The username used to authenticate to the database
|bonita
|db.password
|The password used to authenticate to the database
|bpm
|===


NOTE: If you are using MySQL, add ?allowMultiQueries=true to the URL.
For example, db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bonita-update?allowMultiQueries=true.

=== Stop Bonita 
[WARNING]
====
*IMPORTANT:* Do *not* xref:ROOT:pause-and-resume-bpm-services.adoc[pause the BPM services] before you stop the application server, unless your Bonita source version is higher than 2021.1, otherwise it will cause problems.
====

. Stop the application server.
// link to back up your runtime nodes => old module, new runtime
. *IMPORTANT: Back up your xref:ROOT:back-up-bonita-bpm-platform.adoc[runtime nodes and databases].*

=== Run Bonita Update Tool 
. Go to the directory containing Bonita Update Tool/Bonita Migration Tool.
. Run the appropriate update script:
|===
|*Version* |*Edition* |*Script*
|Bonita Update Tool 3.x
|Community edition
a| 
 * bonita-update-tool (Linux)
 * bonita-update-tool.bat (Windows)
|Bonita Update Tool 3.x
|Subscription edition 
a| 
 * bonita-update-tool-sp (Linux)
 * bonita-update-tool-sp.bat (Windows)
|===

NOTE: A script called _check-update-dryrun_ is available. It can be used as a *pre-update check* as it does all the verification without actually updating the elements. This is equivalent to running the update script with a `--verify` option.

=== Update tool's execution

The script behind the Update tool detects the current version of Bonita and displays a list of the versions available for update. Once you specify the version you are targeting, the updating procedure starts. 

All along script's execution you will be informed of the advancement level with user messages, that you will be asked to confirm for proceeding to the next step. The messages contain important information and we strongly advice you to keep a foreground execution. In case you prefer a background execution without user messages, set to “true” ` (-Dauto.accept=true)` system property.

At the end of the update script execution, the new Runtime version, the database update and the time taken for migrating all the elements will be mentioned in a dedicated user message. 

== After the update tool is completed

[WARNING]
====
*Reminder*
The old Tomcat server cannot be used. You will have to install one that matches the target Bonita Runtime version along with the Bonita binaries. 
====

=== Setup the target Bonita bundle

. Unzip the target bundle version into a directory. In the steps below, this directory will be called bonita-target-version. 

// link to configure the bundle to use the updated database => old module, new runtime
. xref:ROOT:database-configuration.adoc[Configure the bundle to use the updated database.] Do not recreate the database and use xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-platform-setup.adoc[the setup tool] of the bonita-target-version. Edit the bonita-target-version/setup/database.properties file to point to the updated database.

. Download the configuration from database to the local disk using the setup tool of the `bonita-target-version`.
+
There is below a Linux example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd setup
./setup.sh pull
----

. After the setup `pull`, you can change your configuration into the `bonita-target-version/setup/platform_conf/current` folder. 
+
Please refer to the guide on updating the configuration file using the xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[platform setup tool]
+
. When done, push the updated configuration into the database:
+
[source,bash]
----
./setup.sh push
----

=== Specific configuration
If you have done specific configuration and customization actions in your server source version, re-do it by configuring the application server in folder  bonita-target-version/server.

=== Licenses 
// link to Runtime configuration 
Put a new license in the database: see Runtime configuration for further details.
[NOTE] 
====
*Example for Linux*
 cd setup
 vi database.properties
 ./setup.sh pull
 ls -l ./platform_conf/licenses/
====

.If there is no valid license in the /platform_conf/licenses/, these 2 pages will help you request and install a new one:
// link to Licenses => , old module, new runtime
// * xref:ROOT:licenses.adoc[Licenses]
// link to setup tool => old module, new runtime
* xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[Setup tool]
Then, install the new license.


[NOTE] 
====
*Code exemple* 
cp BonitaSubscription-7.n-Jerome-myHosname-20171023-20180122.lic ./platform_conf/licenses/
./setup.sh push
====

=== Start the new Bonita Runtime

* Start the application server and clear your browser cache before you start Bonita Applications or you might see old, cached versions of Portal or Applications pages instead of the new versions.

* Log in to Bonita UIs and verify that the updating procedure has completed.

*The Bonita update is now complete.* 

== Special cases 

=== Updating to Java 11 in Bonita 7.9 or a greater version
Bonita 7.9 and greater versions support Java 11. 

[WARNING] 
====
Updating an existing platform to Java 11 is neither easy nor a painless endeavour. It’s just has to be done. 
====
.Here are the steps to follow: 
* Update Bonita Runtime to Bonita 7.9.0 as usual, and keep running it in Java 8
* Verify that everything works as expected
* Test the target Runtime in Java 11, on a test environment
* Update what is required on the production server
* Switch it to Java 11

The main parts that require attention and testing are connectors and custom code. 

Also, custom connectors, groovy scripts, REST API extensions etc. are not migrated and might not work as expected in Java 11.

Special attention has to be given to custom code dependencies, as they might:
* either not work in Java 11,
* work fine but be in conflict with Bonita dependencies 
* the script might use dependencies previously included in Bonita, but accessible in a different version.

ERROR: Thorough testing has to be carried out to ensure there is no regression when migrating Bonita to version 7.9 and greater.

=== Updating to Bonita 7.11 or a greater version using Oracle
Bonita 7.11 and greater versions support Oracle 19c version. 

.To update to Bonita 7.11 or a greater version when using Oracle, follow this procedure:
* Shut down Bonita Runtime
* Run the migration tool to update to Bonita 7.10.5, following the procedure above
* Update your Oracle database server to version 19c (version 7.10.x is compatible with 12c and 19c.)
* Run the migration tool again to update to Bonita 7.11.0 or greater version
* Restart the new Bonita Runtime

[WARNING]
// link to compatible => OK
====
When updating the Oracle database make sure that the initialization parameter https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/upgrd/what-is-oracle-database-compatibility.html[Compatible] is not set to a previous version. You can check this with the query:
SQL> SELECT name, value FROM v$parameter
WHERE name = 'compatible';
====

=== Updating to Bonita 7.11 or a greater version using SQL Server
Bonita 7.11+ supports SQL Server 2017 version. 

.To update to Bonita 7.11+ when using SQL Server, please follow this procedure:
* ensure your Bonita platform is shut down
* run Bonita Update tool to update Bonita platform to version 7.11.0 or newer, following the above procedure
* then upgrade your SQL Server database server to version 2017
* restart your updated Bonita platform

=== Updating maintenance versions starting with Bonita 7.11
.Starting with Bonita 7.11, updating between maintenance versions of the same main version does not require the Bonita Update Tool, just follow below steps:
* Download the new bundle version from Bonitasoft site for Bonita Community edition or from the Customer Service Center for Bonita Subscription editions
* Shut down your old Bonita Runtime
* Unzip and configure the new bundle This means copying the configuration files of the old Bonita Runtime, mainly database.properties, server.xml, internal.properties if changes have been made.
* Start the new bundle
* Delete the old bundle files

=== Updating a Bonita Runtime cluster
A Bonita Runtime cluster must have the same binary version of Bonita and database version on all nodes.
To update a Bonita Runtime cluster, download the right Bonita dedicated tool: 

|===
|*From Bonita version* |*Till Bonita version* |*Tool version* 
| 6.x.y | 7.0.0 | *Bonita Migration Tool 1.X* A dedicated tool is available for Performance cluster, default Performance migration tool does not support cluster update. 
| 7.0.0 | 7.13.y | *Bonita Migration Tool 2.X* Cluster update included. 
| 7.10.y | latest main version| *Bonita Update Tool 3.X* Cluster update included. 
|===

[NOTE]
====
In a cluster environment, you need to STOP ALL your nodes and update them before starting them with the new maintenance version.
On one node, follow the procedure above to update Bonita Runtime.
When the update is complete on one node, follow steps 12 and 16 on all the other nodes.
The update of the cluster is then complete, and the cluster can be restarted.
====

=== Migrate your client applications 
If you have applications that have Bonita as client, you will have to change your client code or library. 
// link to release notes => 
For backward compatibility checks, refer to the xref:ROOT:release-notes.adoc[release notes].

// link to bonita client library => to decomment 
 In addition, if your application connects to Bonita Engine using the HTTP access mode, see the xref:api:configure-client-of-bonita-bpm-engine.adoc[bonita-client library] documentation page.

== Troubleshooting

=== Timers are stuck after updating to Bonita 7.10.0 or greater versions

_Symptom:_ When updating to Bonita 7.10.0 or a greater version, the timers on processes do not work anymore.
_Cause:_ A bug in the pause/resume mechanism of tenant services, fixed in Bonita 7.12.1. This issue happens because the BPM services were paused before the update was performed.
_Solution:_ If the BPM services were paused before the update or had to be paused for whatever reason, then to resolve this, you need to execute the following database requests after the update completes, and before you restart your Bonita Runtime:
____
DELETE FROM QRTZ_PAUSED_TRIGGER_GRPS;

UPDATE QRTZ_TRIGGERS SET TRIGGER_STATE = 'WAITING' WHERE TRIGGER_STATE = 'PAUSED';
____

After this operation, the table QRTZ_PAUSED_TRIGGER_GRPS should be empty, and all the triggers in the QRTZ_TRIGGERS table should be in state _waiting_, and not _paused_.

=== Some foreign keys are duplicated
[NOTE] 
====
This issue is fixed in Bonita 7.11.6, without any action required from the platform administrator.
====
_Symptom:_ After updating to a Bonita version comprised between 7.11.0 and 7.11.5, after re-installing/updating the BDM, some foreign key constraints are effectively duplicated: there are foreign keys that refer to the same columns and tables, but with a different name.
_Cause:_ A bug was introduced in Bonita 7.11.0 by upgrading an external library, Hibernate, from version 4 to 5. 
// link to know bugs 
This new version introduces xref:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-13779[a known bug].

_Solution:_ Doing nothing is an option, as there are no changes in Bonita’s behaviour. 
Still, if you wish to clean your BDM database, follow the procedure below:

* Stop your bonita server
* Open the database in an edition tool or execute in command line the relevant commands. 

Select all the foreign keys on a table of *your BDM objects*: 
|===
|*MySQL* | 
SELECT
TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_NAME,CONSTRAINT_NAME, REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE
REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = '<your_business_data_db_name>' AND
REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = '<your_table_name>';
|*MS SQL Server* |
select
name [foreign key constraint name],
OBJECT_NAME(parent_object_id) [created table],
OBJECT_NAME(referenced_object_id) [referenced table]
from sys.foreign_keys
where
parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('<your_table_name>') OR
referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID('<your_table_name>')
|*PostgreSQL* |
SELECT conname,
pg_catalog.pg_get_constraintdef(r.oid, true) as condef
FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint r
WHERE r.conrelid = '<your_table_name>'::regclass AND r.contype = 'f' ORDER BY 1
|===

* These requests will give you all the foreign keys on a table. Among these, search for duplicated ones: the duplicated foreign keys should have the following names: FK_<hash> & FK<another_hash>. The two different names should be for keys referencing the same columns on the same table. Delete the one named: FK_<hash>.

* Repeat for all the tables of your BDM database.

* Start your Bonita Runtime

[WARNING]
====
Guidance is not provided for Oracle, as the situation is impossible. Oracle prevents the creation of 2 identical foreign keys with different names. Instead, the BDM redeployment will fail after migration. Updating to Bonita 7.11.6 or greater versions fixes the issue.
====
