:description: Learn how to change Bonita edition: move from a Bonita Community to any Bonita Enterprise or vice-versa

{description}

*Upgrading* means moving from a Bonita Community edition environment to any Bonita Enterprise edition environment.

*Downgrading* means moving from a Bonita Enterprise edition environment to a Bonita Community edition environment.

== To check before upgrading / downgrading

A Bonita edition upgrade can only be performed between environments having the same Bonita version.

[NOTE]
====
* *POSSIBLE* - upgrade from a Bonita 2021.2 Community edition to Bonita 2021.2 Enterprise edition.
* *NOT POSSIBLE* - upgrade from Bonita 2021.2 Community to Bonita 2021.3 Enterprise. +
====

Updating to a newer version at the same time as upgrading to the Enterprise edition is *NOT* an option. +

Everything above is also applicable for the downgrade process.

== Upgrade process

An upgrade has to be performed independently on Bonita components.

=== Bonita Studio

To upgrade a Community edition of Bonita Studio and its resources (such as process diagrams, data models), follow these steps:

. xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-studio-installation.adoc[Install a Bonita  Studio] Enterprise edition.
. If you are using GIT, clone your project, it will be upgraded during the clone operation
. If you are not using GIT :
.. Export your projects from the Bonita Studio Community edition to `.bos` archives. We recommend that you keep those archives as a backup.
.. Import your `.bos` archives into the Bonita Studio in Enterprise edition.

The upgrade is performed automatically and silently when importing resources into Bonita Studio Enterprise edition.

=== Bonita Runtime

Upgrading a Bonita Runtime allows you to keep its data (process definitions, cases, BDM...) while benefiting from the Enterprise edition features.

[NOTE]
====
The *upgrade procedure* is quite simple with an execution time of less than 30 minutes.

A *service downtime* will be required.
====

[WARNING]
====
A Bonita Runtime upgrade can only be performed on the same database vendor (E.g. PostgreSQL) and on the same Bonita version (E.g. Bonita 2021.2 (=_7.13_))
====

To upgrade a Bonita Runtime from a Community edition to an Enterprise edition, follow these steps:

. Download and unzip the Bonita Enterprise bundle (to retrieve the bonita.war Web App later)
. Retrieve an xref:ROOT:licenses.adoc[Enterprise license] file
. Run `<bonita-installation>/setup/setup(.sh/.bat) pull` to fetch your current Community configuration in `<bonita-installation>/setup/platform_conf/current`
. Create license folder `<bonita-installation>/setup/platform_conf/licenses/`
. Copy your license file into this newly-created folder
. Push your new license in the database: `<bonita-installation>/setup/setup(.sh/.bat) push`
. Stop Bonita Community platform with `<bonita-installation>/stop-bonita(.sh/.bat)` script. *Do not remove the WAR file before stopping Tomcat, or many errors would be issued in the log* (See <<bonita-runtime-notes, note 1 for explanations>>)
. Remove Bonita Community Web App from `<bonita-installation>/server/webapps`: both `bonita.war` and the auto-extracted folder with the same name `bonita/`
. Copy the Bonita Enterprise Web App (extracted from Bonita Enterprise bundle) where the Community version was: `<bonita-installation>/server/webapps/bonita.war`
. ⚠ (Optionally rename the `<bonita-installation>` folder with a name that does not contain anymore the word `community`, for clarity)
. Start the upgraded Bonita Runtime using `<bonita-installation>/start-bonita(.sh/.bat)` script

At this stage, everything is functional.

[#bonita-runtime-notes]
[NOTE]
====
If you remove Bonita webapp folder while Tomcat is running, Tomcat server considers that the webapp should be completely unloaded and removed. It also deletes the webapp configuration file `<bonita-installation>/server/conf/Catalina/localhost/bonita.xml`, resulting in many errors in the log files. Hopefully, Bonita restores this file during next run of `start-bonita(.sh/.bat)` script.
====

The upgrade is now finished, you can verify that you are now running an Enterprise edition in the Super Administrator application; the edition displayed in the "BPM Services" page should indicate Enterprise edition.

Once you have started Bonita Enterprise Runtime at least once, you can pull your Enterprise configuration (`<install>/setup/setup(.sh/.bat) pull`)
and change the Enterprise-specific configuration files to match your needs. See xref:runtime:bonita-platform-setup.adoc[Bonita Runtime setup tool] for details about
how to apply configuration changes.

==== Bonita Applications

Starting with Bonita 2021.2, Bonita Portal has been replaced with Bonita Applications.
In Enterprise edition, an additional application for administrators is available for manual import - Bonita Administrator Application.

Here are the steps to follow :

. Go to `<bonita-installation>/server/webapps/bonita/WEB-INF/classes/org/bonitasoft/web/application/`.
. Unzip the file `bonita-admin-application-sp-7.x.y.zip`. You should have an xml and a png file.
. Connect to the bonita platform using a super administrator user.
. Go to applications, import the xml file.
. ⚠ (Optionally, click on more details of your newly imported application, and import the png file as logo)
. ⚠ (Optionally, delete the community version of the administrator application to avoid unnecessary confusion)


== Downgrade

[WARNING]
====
Downgrading to Bonita Community edition means you will not be able to use Bonita Enterprise edition features anymore,
so a prerequisite is to ensure you do not use any of these features before downgrading. Neither in your processes, nor in
the Runtime settings.
====

=== Bonita Studio

To downgrade an Enterprise edition of Bonita Studio and its resources (such as process diagrams, data models), follow these steps:

. xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-studio-installation.adoc[Install a Bonita  Studio] Community edition.
. If you are using GIT, clone your project, it will be downgraded during the clone operation
. if you are not using GIT
.. Export your projects from the Bonita Studio Enterprise edition to `.bos` archives. We recommend that you keep those archives as a backup.
.. Import your `.bos` archives into the Community edition of Bonita Studio.

The downgrade is performed automatically and silently when importing resources into Bonita Studio Community edition.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to import a project built with Bonita Enterprise edition from Git, you just need to clone the project from GitHub in Bonita Studio Community edition.
====

=== Bonita Runtime

To downgrade a Bonita Runtime from an Enterprise edition to a Community edition, follow these steps:

. Download and unzip the Bonita Community bundle (to retrieve the bonita.war Web App later)
. Stop Bonita Enterprise Runtime with `<bonita-installation>/stop-bonita(.sh/.bat)` script. *Do not remove the WAR file before stopping Tomcat, or many errors would be issued in the log* (See <<bonita-runtime-notes, note 1 for explanations>>)
. Remove Bonita Enterprise Web App from `<bonita-installation>/server/webapps`: both `bonita.war` and the auto-extracted folder with the same name `bonita/`
. Copy the Bonita Community Web App (extracted from Bonita Community bundle) where the Enterprise version was: `<bonita-installation>/server/webapps/bonita.war`
. ⚠ (Optionally rename the `<bonita-installation>` folder with a name that does not contain anymore the word `subscription` or `enterprise`, for clarity)
. Start the downgraded Bonita Runtime using `<bonita-installation>/start-bonita(.sh/.bat)` script

The downgrade is now finished, you can verify that you are now running a Community edition in the Super Administrator application; the edition displayed in the "BPM Services" page should indicate Community edition.

You should also ensure that there are no errors in the log file, referencing Enterprise features.
