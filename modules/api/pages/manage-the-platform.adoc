:description: With Bonita Engine API, you can create and initialize the platform, start and stop the Bonita Engine.

{description}

. *Log on the platform*
+
Before you can create the platform, you need to log in and get the platformAPI:
+
[source,bash]
----
// Get platform login API using the PlatformAPIAccessor
PlatformLoginAPI platformLoginAPI = PlatformAPIAccessor.getPlatformLoginAPI();

// Log on the platform
PlatformSession platformSession = platformLoginAPI.login("platformAdmin", "platform");

// Get the platform API
PlatformAPI platformAPI = PlatformAPIAccessor.getPlatformAPI(platformSession);
----
+
. *Create the platform*
+
This will create the database structure and put the platform state into persistent storage.
+
[source,bash]
----
// Create the platform
platformAPI.createPlatform();
----
+
. *Initialize the platform*
+
This will create the default tenant and initialize Bonita Engine environment.
After this step, the technical user will be able to connect to the engine and create new users or xref:ROOT:manage-an-organization.adoc[import the organization].
+
[source,bash]
----
// Initialize the platform
platformAPI.initializePlatform();
----
+
No business users are created by default and the default username/password for the technical user to connect to Bonita Engine can be retrieved in the file `setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/[tenant_id]/tenant_engine/bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` using the xref:runtime:bonita-platform-setup.adoc[plaform setup tool] (`[tenant_id]` being the default tenant ID, that is to say `1` when using the default configuration on a fresh installation).
+
Once you retrieved the default configuration using the xref:runtime:bonita-platform-setup.adoc[platform setup tool], you can change this username/password by editing the file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` and use the tool again to xref:bonita-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[push the configuration to database].
+
. *Start Bonita engine*
+
Starting the engine on a node starts the Scheduler service and restarts elements that were not finished by the Work service on the previous shutdown. Bonita Engine environment is marked as activated.
+
[source,bash]
----
// Start the execution engine
platformAPI.startNode();
----
+
. *Stop Bonita engine*
+
Stopping the node stops the Scheduler service. Bonita Engine environment is marked as deactivated.
+
[source,bash]
----
// Stop the execution engine
platformAPI.stopNode();
----
