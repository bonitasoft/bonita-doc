Learn how to write and execute integration tests for your Bonita processes to improve the quality and the durability of your developments using the Bonita Test Toolkit. +
Developer skills are required to follow this documentation and, generally, to write process integration tests.

[NOTE]
====
Integrations tests are built upon the Bonita Test Toolkit, based on the open-source https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-java-client[Bonita Java Client]. +
The Bonita Test Toolkit is only available for Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions.

== Motivations

In the world of development, writing tests is not an option. It is the best way to ensure that a product fulfills its requirements and that existing features won't be broken by future developments. 

This applies to Bonita processes. For each process, an integration test should be written, to validate that the process executes correctly depending on the inputs, that after each task the platform is in the expected state, and so on.

The Bonita Test Toolkit offers the possibility to write such tests. It performs HTTP calls on the targeted Bonita platform to start and execute cases, and make assertions at any time on the state of the platform, the content of the data... +
It is a Java library and can be integrated with many existing test frameworks like JUnit 5, Spock, Cucumber...etc.
