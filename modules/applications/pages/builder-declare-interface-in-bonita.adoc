== Declare the interface in Bonita application descriptor

The xref:applications:application-creation.adoc[Bonita application descriptor] is a file that let you describe all your applications.

To declare a Bonita UI Builder interface in it, edit it in Studio using the `source` tab.
In this tab, you will be able to declare your application built and packaged with Bonita UI Builder, using auto-completion with an `applicationLink` XML tag.

In this example, the _General Overview_ application is declared with the tag:

[source,xml]
----
     <applicationLink token="appLink" version="1.0" profile="User" state="ACTIVATED">
         <displayName>General Overview</displayName>
     </applicationLink>
----

There are fewer properties to set for an application link than for a legacy application, but the `displayName` is still mandatory.

The `token` property's value must be identical to the value of the `slug` key found in the xref:package-and-deploy-your-application.adoc#_export_your_application[JSON export of your application]. For example, if your application name is _Awesome application_, its `slug` should be _awesome-application_.

Once your application descriptor is done, don't forget to deploy it by clicking the `deploy` button in the Studio.
