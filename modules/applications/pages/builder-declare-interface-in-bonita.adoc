== Declare the interface in Bonita application descriptor

The xref:applications:application-creation.adoc[Bonita application descriptor] is a file that let you describe all your applications.

To declare a Bonita UI Builder interface in it, edit it in Studio using the `source` tab.
In this tab, you will be able to declare your application built and packaged with Bonita UI Builder, using auto-completion with a `advancedApplication` XML tag.

In this example, the _Advanced Overview_ application is declared with the tag:

[source,xml]
----
     <advancedApplication token="advanced" version="1.0" profile="User" state="ACTIVATED">
         <displayName>Advanced Overview</displayName>
     </advancedApplication>
----

There are fewer properties to set for an advanced application than for a legacy application, but the `displayName` is still mandatory.

Full form edition support will come in a future release.
