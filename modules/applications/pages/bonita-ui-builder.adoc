== Bonita UI Builder


Bonita UI Builder is a development environment made for designing all kind of interfaces, pages, forms, for your applications. It brings a host of advanced features and improved usability, designed to help you create even more compelling and user-friendly interfaces: a set of more than 45 widgets, a wide gallery template, code completion, custom JS code, native debugging option, a restriction-free drag & drop interface, import and export JSON options, React interfaces, and many more.

Bonita UI Builder is an application-centric development environment that allows for designing forms and application pages, without distinction. You can now design fully-fledged applications, embedding dashboards and complex interfaces. Or, you can just design single-page applications. The choice is up to you. 

With Bonita UI Builder, you can still manage your workflows, continuous integration, etc., the way you’re managing them now. 

We offer xref:applications:initiation-manual.adoc[extensive documentation], xref:applications:how-tos-builder.adoc[tutorials], and a xref:applications:faq.adoc[FAQ] to help you make the most of Bonita UI Builder.



== Applications

Applications are created and operated within Bonita Platform, created with Bonita Studio and Bonita UI Builder, deployed with Bonita Continuous Delivery, run by Bonita Runtime. 

They are a navigation of pages that can be accessed by a xref:identity:profiles-overview.adoc[Profile]. They aim to display and structure the right information and provide the right controls at the right time to the profiles, so they can efficiently perform their tasks. Once pushed to production, Applications cannot be live edited.

Bonita also comes with four Bonita Applications.

“Applications” are very similar to “Living Applications”, which are created with Bonita UI Designer and will be phased out.
