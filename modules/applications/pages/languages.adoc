= Bonita is available in different languages
:page-aliases: ROOT:languages.adoc
:description: Bonita is officially released in various languages but is open to more translations from the Community.

{description}

== Languages available by default

The following languages are officially supported:

* English (US)
* French
* Spanish (Latin America)
* Japanese
* Brazilian Portuguese

Officially supported language means that:

* Translation is performed by Bonitasoft or trusted partners
* The following Bonita components are translated: Studio, UI Designer and Bonita Applications

== Language detection mechanism

Since Bonita 7.11.0, when a user accesses a page of Bonita Applications, the language used to display the page is detected using the following priority order:

. `locale` parameter value in the URL if it is present (E.g.: `?locale=pt_BR`)
. BOS_Locale cookie value
. Web browser preferred language (first locale sent in the request header Accept-Language)
. English if none of the previous ones are set and/or supported

[NOTE]
====

When a language different from the one already set in the BOS_Locale cookie is passed in the URL (`locale` parameter), then the cookie value is reset with this new language.
This can be used to force the default language if needed (by simply providing a link to Bonita Applications with the locale parameter).
====

== Select a language in a Bonita application

To select another language, if the application uses the default xref:bonita-layout.adoc[Bonita layout]:

. Click on the username or icon in the top right corner of the application header
. In the modal window, go to the language section and select a language from the drop-down list
. Click on the "Apply" button
. Close the modal window

== Select a language in a Custom Application

If the application uses the default xref:bonita-layout.adoc[Bonita layout], the header is the same as a Bonita Application, so the procedure is the same. +
If the layout has been customized, users need to refer to the internally documented procedure.

== Add a new language

[NOTE]
====
This part is a legacy way to add a new language and will be reworked in the future. +
Instructions below assume that the language you want to add is already available in the Community translation project. If translation is not available see <<Translate_Bonita_Runtime,Translate Bonita Runtime>> for instruction about how to collaborate to a new or ongoing translation.
====

Instructions below explain how to add a language to the Bonita Runtime. Steps below involve using content created by Bonitasoft community and therefore not officially supported.

==== Download the language files

. Go to http://translate.bonitasoft.org/[Bonita translation project].
. Select the language you are interested in.
. Make sure you click on the "Toggle Hidden Files" button image:images/crowdin_toggle_hidden_files.png[Toggle hidden files button] to see already fully translated files.
. Browse the file tree to `{bonitaVersion}/bonita-web/portal` folder.
. For each file in the folder: open it and in the *_File_* menu click on *_Download_*. Each `.po/.pot` file has a language indicator and a locale indicator. For example, the files for the Brazilian Portuguese language end with `pt_BR.po`.
. For Subscription editions, you also need to get the files from `{bonitaVersion}/bonita-web-sp/portal` folder.

==== Install the files and configure java

. Create a new folder depending on the situation:
 ** `[TOMCAT_HOME]/server/i18n/`
 ** `[STUDIO_HOME]/workspace/tomcat/server/i18n/`
. Copy all the `.po/.pot` files into the new folder just created.
. Declare a new JVM property *`org.bonitasoft.i18n.folder`* and set the value to the full path to `i18n` folder:
 ** Tomcat on Windows, edit the `[TOMCAT_HOME]\setup\tomcat-templates\setenv.bat` file: *`"-Dorg.bonitasoft.i18n.folder=C:\path_to_i18n_folder"`*
 ** Tomcat on Linux, edit the `[TOMCAT_HOME]/setup/tomcat-templates/setenv.sh` file: *`-Dorg.bonitasoft.i18n.folder="/path_to_i18n_folder"`*
 ** Tomcat embedded in Bonita Studio edit the appropriate .ini file and use the following syntax: *`-Dtomcat.extra.params="-Dorg.bonitasoft.i18n.folder=C:\path\to_i18n_folder"`*
  *** Windows 64bit: `[STUDIO_HOME]/BonitaStudioSubscription64.ini`
  *** Linux 64bit: `[STUDIO_HOME]/BonitaStudioSubscription64-linux.ini`
  *** etc.
. Restart your application server (or Click on Server in the Bonita Studio menu bar, click on Restart Web Server).
. Check that the new language is listed in the available languages of the Bonita layout.
