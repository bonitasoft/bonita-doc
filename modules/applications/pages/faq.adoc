== My application link is incorrect when accessing the Application Directory from my custom application.

If you have customized e.g. the Bonita User Application, you may be using an old version of the layout.

In that case, the Application Directory opened from that application only will not display Application Links correctly, but the same way as Legacy Applications. +
Fix this by using `custompage_layoutBonita` as the layout value, which will automatically migrate to the latest layout.

You may also encounter this issue if you use a xref:applications:customize-layouts.adoc[customized layout] instead of the official one. In that case, update your application's layout by re-applying your modifications to the latest layout version that implements the improvements for Application Links.

The same applies to the Application directory page that is used in the default application directory app: if you use a customized version of it, you need to re-apply your changes on the latest version packaged with Bonita runtime.
