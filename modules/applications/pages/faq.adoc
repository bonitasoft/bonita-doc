:description:Find here the answers to the frenquently asked questions about Bonita UI Builder and Application Links.

== My application link is incorrect when accessing the Application Directory from my custom application.

If you have customized e.g. the Bonita User Application, you may be using an old version of the layout.

In that case, the Application Directory opened from that application only will not display Application Links correctly, but the same way as Legacy Applications. +
Fix this by using `custompage_layoutBonita` as the layout value, which will automatically migrate to the latest layout.

You may also encounter this issue if you use a xref:ROOT:applications:customize-layouts.adoc[customized layout] instead of the official one. In that case, adapt your layout and report your modifications to the latest layout version that implements the latest improvements for Application Links.
