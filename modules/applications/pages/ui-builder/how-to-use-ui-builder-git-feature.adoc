== Core components

* **Version Control Integration:** Connect with any Git hosting provider of your choice.
* **Branch Protection:** Protect one branche to maintain codebase integrity.
* **Default Branch:** See your default branch for different environments.


== Getting started

Version control in Bonita UI Builder is similar to the traditional Git workflow.

* Different users who want to collaborate must install Bonita UI Builder locally.
* A user needs to xref:./version-control-with-git/git-settings#_from_user_profile[configure] a git email and a git name from their profile for their local installation.
* xref:./version-control-with-git/connect-git[Connect] to a Git repository from the application settings.


[NOTE]
====
* A user can xref:./version-control-with-git/git-settings#_from_an_application[configure] a git email and a git name on each application they are working on.
* Each application is associated with a single git repository. A repository cannot be used for multiple applications.
