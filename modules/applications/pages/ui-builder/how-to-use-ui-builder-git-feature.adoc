[WARNING]
====
The Git feature in Bonita UI Builder is currently in beta.

Please note that the Git feature in Bonita UI Builder is independent of Bonita's main Git functionality. It is designed specifically for application development collaboration.
====

Bonita UI Builder allows you to connect to Git using any provider via a remote *SSH* URL. The following instructions apply to popular Git providers, including GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Azure.

== Key Features

* **Version Control Integration:** Connect to any Git hosting provider of your choice.
* **Branch Protection:** Protect a specific branch to ensure the integrity of your code base.
* **Default Branch:** View your default branch.

== Getting Started

Using version control in Bonita UI Builder follows a typical Git workflow.

* Collaborators must have Bonita UI Builder installed locally.
* Each user needs to xref:./version-control-with-git/git-settings#_access_to_git_settings_from_your_user_profile[set] their git email and username in their local installation profile.
* From the application settings, xref:./version-control-with-git/connect-git[connect] to a Git repository.

[NOTE]
====
* Users can xref:./version-control-with-git/git-settings#_access_to_git_settings_from_an_application[configure] their git email and username for each application they work on.
* Each application can only be associated with one Git repository, and a single repository cannot be shared across multiple applications.
