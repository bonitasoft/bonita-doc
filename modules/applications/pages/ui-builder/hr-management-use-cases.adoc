:description: Explore the most commonly used APIs and JS objects for building an app like HR Management in UIB.

{description}


The HR Management application developed using Bonita UI Builder is a comprehensive solution designed to manage various HR related tasks such as onboarding new employee, vacation management, organizational structure, etc.
While this application was developed with the assistance of Bonita developers, customers building similar applications on their own may face challenges due to the complexity involved.
This documentation aims to provide an overview of the use cases, relevant code snippets, JavaScript functions, and platform-specific elements that are integral to the HR Management application.

JS Functions: dynamically generates organizational charts, manages role assignments, and updates department details.


=== Commonly used APIs

Here are the most frequently used APIs for building an HR Management application. These APIs are robust and well-suited for creating an application in UI Builder.

==== Session
The session API is useful for retrieving session information for the current user.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/system/session/unusedId`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Session/operation/getSession[session API documentation].

==== Users
The users API is useful for retrieving a list of users by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/identity/user?c=10&p=0&time=0&o=lastname+ASC&f=enabled=true`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/User/operation/searchUsers[users API documentation].

==== Human tasks
The human tasks API is useful to retrieve a list of human tasks by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/bpm/humanTask?c=10&p=0&f=state=ready&f=caseId=[caseId]`

For more details information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/HumanTask/operation/searchHumanTasks[human tasks api documentation].

==== User task context
The user task context API provides the context for a specific user task identified by its id.

For example:

    - GET | `/bonita/API/bpm/userTask/[taskId]/context`

For more details information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/UserTask/operation/getContextByUserTaskId[context by userTask id api documentation].

==== Processes
The process API is used to retrieve a list of process by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/bonita/API/bpm/process?c=10&p=0&f=name=[processName]&f=activationState=ENABLED` retrieves a list of specific process.
    - POST | `/bonita/API/bpm/process/[processId]/instantiation` is used to instantiate a process.

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Process/operation/searchProcesses[processes API documentation].

==== Business data
The business data is useful to find business data with pagination params and filters by invoking a `Named Query`. It allows to call either default or custom business data queries.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/bdm/businessData/com.company.hr.[businessObject]?q=[query]&p=0&c=10&f=[filterString]={filterParam}`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/BusinessDataQuery/operation/searchBusinessData[business data api documentation].

==== Professional contact data
The professional contact data is useful to retrieve the professional contact details of a user by their id.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/identity/professionalcontactdata/[userId]`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/ProfessionalContactData/operation/getProfessionalContactDataById[professional contact data api documentation].

==== Group
The group api is used to retrieve a list of groups by applying pagination params and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/identity/group?c=10&p=0&d=parent_group_id&t=0&o=displayName%20ASC`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Group/operation/searchGroups[groups api documentation].

==== Upload file
The upload file api is used to upload a file of any type, typically before submitting a process or task form that includes a document in its contract.

For example:

    - POST | `/bonita/API/formFileUpload`

For information on uploading multiple files, refer to the xref:ui-builder/how-to-upload-multiple-documents.adoc[upload multiple files.]


[NOTE]
In addition to the commonly used APIs, JS objects can also be created to meet specific application needs.
