:description: Step-by-step guide to transition from development to production using Bonita UI Builder


Once you've designed an application that interacts with your xref:interact-with-your-bonita-process.adoc[Bonita process], and xref:builder-declare-interface-in-bonita.adoc[declared] it in Bonita, it's time to push your application to production.

== Move from Development to Production

[[export-application]]
=== Export your application

Once the design is complete, export the application(s) as JSON file from Bonita UI Builder by clicking the `export` button on the home page. This export will be used for building the production binary.

[[store-application]]
=== Store your application in a workspace folder

Move the exported JSON application(s) in a designated `workspace` folder. This folder will be referenced during the build process.
You can store these applications in a Git repository too.

=== Build the production binary

To create the production-ready binary, you need to build a Docker image. This image will contain the application(s) and the Bonita UI Builder runtime.

The xref:production-packaging.adoc#dockerfile[Dockerfile] and more details on how to build the Docker image can be found in this xref:production-packaging.adoc[dedicated page].

=== Run the Docker image

After building the Docker image, run it using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --name <container-name> <image-name>:<version>
----
See xref:production-packaging.adoc#run-production-binary[run production binary page] for more details.

=== Access your Application

Once the Docker image is running, all applications contained in the `workspace` folder will be:

- Imported
- Published
- Made available for users

Then, these applications can be accessed from the Bonita Administrator Application and the Bonita Application Directory page.

== Troubleshooting

[.troubleshooting-section]
--
[.symptom]
After building and running the Bonita UI Builder, at least one application are missing.

[.cause]#Cause#
The application is on error and the Bonita UI Builder is not able to import and deploy the application.

[.solution]#Solution#
Check the log of the bonita-ui-builder container with `docker logs <container-name>` to find which application is on error.
Then fix your application and be sure your export are compatible and a valid JSON.

[.troubleshooting-section]
--
[.symptom]
After building and running the Bonita UI Builder, no application can be seen or found in production.

[.cause]#Cause#
This is probably due to an error when the application was xref:builder-declare-interface-in-bonita.adoc[declared] in the Application Descriptor. Bonita UI Builder is therefore unable to find the application's location.

[.solution]#Solution#
Ensure the application designed with Bonita UI Builder is declared using the `<advancedLink>` tag. Then, save and deploy the Application Descriptor by clicking the `deploy` button in the Studio.
Also, make sure the `token` value is identical to the value of the `slug` key found in the xref:package-and-deploy-your-application.adoc#export-application[JSON export of the application]. If several `slug` keys are found in the JSON export, you should take the value of the first `slug` key.
