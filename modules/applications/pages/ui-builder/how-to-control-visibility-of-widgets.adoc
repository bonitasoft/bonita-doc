== Using JavaScript

Widgets' visibility can be controlled by JavaScript. Let’s say you want to make a widget visible on specific conditions, for example if another widget contains a specific string. 
Click the `JS` button on your widget’s settings:

Add this small portion of code to make the `Text22` widget visible if the other text widget contains the string “Bonita” :

== Using the storeValue() function

The `storeValue()` function stores the data in the browser's local storage as key-value pairs that represent storage objects and can be later accessed anywhere in the application.

Let us create “Show” and “Hide” buttons, which, on click, make another widget appear or disappear.

First, drag and drop a button widget, and change its `onClick` setting to `Store value`. Then, set its key and value:

Do the same for another button widget whose `Value` will equal `false` instead of `true`.

Then, drag and drop a text widget, click the little `JS` button next to `Visible`, and type the following code:

Preview your application and try clicking on the button widgets. It works!

The `Visible` state also works for widgets other than text widgets. Try it out!
