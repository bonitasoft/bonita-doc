:description: Learn how to upload multiple documents simultaneously

{description}

* Difficulty: intermediate
* Prerequisites: have an xref:create-an-interface.adoc[interface created] on Bonita UI Builder

If you need to upload multiple files using Bonita's formFileUpload servlet, you'll need to process each file separately by looping through them, adding a parameter to the API query for each file. Since Bonita's `formFileUpload` doesn't support uploading multiple files at once, you'll also need to synchronize the uploads.


== Example

Suppose you want to upload multiple files at the same time using a `FilePicker` widget in the Bonita UI Builder.

=== 1. Use a FilePicker widget
To do so, drag and drop a `FilePicker` widget onto your interface and configure it as follows:

[TIP]
In this example, we don't set a limit for the `Max no. of files` because we're allowing multiple files to be uploaded. However, you can set a limit on the number of files to be uploaded, as well as adjust other properties if needed.


=== 2. Create a post request
* Go to `Queries` section and create a new query/API and configure it as follows:

=== 3. Create JavaScript object

* Go to `JS` section and create a new JS object to create functions given below that allows to upload multiple files simultaneously.

* Function to get files
[source, JS]
----
export default {
     async getFileUpload () {
		const files = testFileUpload.files;

		const promises = files.map((file) => {
			return upload_files.run({ fileName: file });
		});

		try {
			const results = await Promise.all(promises);
			const santizedResult = results.map(result => JSON.parse(result));
			return santizedResult;
		} catch (error) {
			console.error('The error is ', error);
			throw error;
		}
	}
 }
----

The `getFileUpload` function is an asynchronous function that uploads multiple files concurrently. It retrieves the files from `testFileUpload.files` and maps each file to an upload promise using `upload_files.run()`.
These promises are then executed simultaneously using `Promise.all`. Once all uploads are complete, the function parses the results into JSON objects and returns them.
The function also includes error handling, logging any errors that occur during the upload process and re-throwing them for further handling.

* Function to upload files

[source, JS]
----
export default {
     async uploadFiles() {
		if(testFileUpload.files.length > 2) {
			const result = await this.getFileUpload();
			return result;
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}
 }
----

The `uploadFiles` function triggers the file upload process only when more than two files are selected.
It calls the `getFileUpload` function that we created previously to perform the upload and returns the result.
If fewer than three files are selected, the function simply returns null, bypassing the upload process.
You can modify the file count according to your preferences.

=== 4. Bind function to the FilePicker widget

* Go to the `UI` and select `testFileUpload` widget and bind the `uploadFiles` function to the `onFilesSelected` event.
