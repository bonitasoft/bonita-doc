:description: Discover how to troubleshoot errors encountered while importing a page into the application in UI Builder.

{description}

* Difficulty: beginner
* Prerequisites: have an application on Bonita UI Builder
* Estimated time: 5 minutes

Imagine you're importing a page into an existing application, and Bonita UI Builder notifies you that the page has been partially imported, displaying some errors, warnings, or informational messages.

== Concerning the Queries

To resolve this,
 * Navigate to the Queries section and select the query from the sidebar that is causing the issue
 * Go to the Settings tab
 * Enable the "Run API on page load" option
 * Refresh your browser

This will resolve the issue if it was caused by queries that were supposed to be executed on page load.


== Concerning JavaScript objects

If you encounter similar errors or warnings related to JavaScript functions during page import, follow these steps to resolve the issue:
 * Navigate to the JS section and choose the JS object from the sidebar that's causing the problem
 * Go to the Settings tab
 * Enable the "Run on page load" option for the affected JS function
 * Refresh your browser

[NOTE]
===
Ensure that any conditional logic used in these queries or functions (e.g., using `if` conditions to decide whether they should run) is correct and returns `true` on page load.
