:description: Discover how to make your application accessible in multiple languages.

{description}

* Difficulty: beginner
* Prerequisites: have an application on Bonita UI Builder

Suppose you're creating an application and want to allow users to easily switch between several languages by choosing a language option.
While UIB currently doesn't have a built-in feature for making an application multilingual, you can achieve this manually by following the steps outlined below.


== Example

=== 1 Design app interface
* Drag and drop a Select widget onto your interface, name it SelectLanguage, and configure the Source Data property as follows:

[source, JS]
----
[
  {
    "key": "English",
    "value": "en"
  },
  {
    "key": "Francaise",
    "value": "fr"
  },
  {
    "key": "Spanish",
    "value": "es"
  }
]
----

* Now, drag and drop a `Text` widget onto your interface and add a sentence into its `Text` property.
For example, `This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibility of making it available in multiple languages.`


=== 2 Define JS objects
* Go to the JS section, create a new JavaScript object, and name it localization.
* In the `localization` file, define JavaScript objects for each language to correspond with the values set for the `SelectLanguage` widget. Include the words or sentences along with their translations as key-value pairs for all languages, as shown in the code snippet below:

[source, JS]
----
export default {
	translations: {
		en: {
			"This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibility of making it available in multiple languages.": "This is a sample application to demonstrate the posibility of making it available in multi-languages."
		},
		fr: {
			"This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibility of making it available in multiple languages.": "Il s'agit d'un exemple d'application visant à démontrer la possibilité de le rendre disponible en plusieurs langues."
		},
		es: {
			"This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibility of making it available in multiple languages.": "Esta es una aplicación de muestra para demostrar la posibilidad de hacerlo disponible en varios idiomas."
		}
	}
}
----


[NOTE]
====
Ensure that all language keys match the values set in the SelectLanguage source data, such as en, fr, and es, etc.
====

* To keep the codebase organized, define another JavaScript object and name it i18n.
* Copy and paste the JavaScript code blocks provided below:

[source, JS]
----
export default {
	languageKeys: {},
	onLanguageChange() {
		this.languageKeys = localization.translations[SelectLanguage.selectedOptionValue];
	},
	setLangugeKey() {
		this.languageKeys = localization.translations["en"];
		return this.languageKeys;
	}
}
----

This JavaScript module manages language translations using the `languageKeys` property. The `onLanguageChange()` method updates `languageKeys` based on the selected language, while `setLangugeKey()` sets it to the default English translations and returns the updated object.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the `Run on page load` setting is enabled for the `setLanguageKey` function.
====


=== 3 Bind JS objects to the widgets
* Come back to the UI section and select the `SelectLanguage` widget.
* Set its `Label` to `{{i18n.languageKeys["Select language"]}}`.
* In the Events property, set `{{i18n.onLanguageChange();}}` to invoke the function when the language changes.
* Then, select the text widget and set the `Text` property to `{{i18n.languageKeys["This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibility of making it available in multiple languages."]}}`.
