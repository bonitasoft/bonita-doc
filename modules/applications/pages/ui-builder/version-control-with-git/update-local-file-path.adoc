= Update the local file path
:page-aliases: applications:update-local-file-path.adoc
:description: For self-hosted instances, Bonita UI Builder clones Git repositories to the local file system associated with the persistent volume inside the Docker container.

{description}

* Difficulty: Beginner
* Estimated time: 15 minutes
* Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Docker

== Instructions

1. Modify the `APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT` environment variable to point to the desired file path.
2. Restart the Docker container to apply the new settings.

[NOTE]
====
If the file path is not set correctly, the cloned Git repositories will not be saved persistently. To avoid data loss, make sure that persistent storage is configured.

Bonita UI Builder will attempt to clone repositories again if they are removed, such as during a Docker restart.
