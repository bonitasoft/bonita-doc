:page-aliases: applications:update-local-file-path.adoc
:description: For self-hosted instances, Bonita UI Builder clones the Git repositories in the local file system, attached to the persistent volume within the Docker container.

* Difficulty: beginner
* Estimated time: 15 minutes
* Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Docker

== Steps

1. Update the `APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT` environment variable.
2. Restart the container to apply changes.

[NOTE]
====
If the file path is missing, Git repositories are cloned but not persisted. To avoid potential loss, it's important to set up persistent storage.

Bonita UI Builder will try to re-clone repositories if they're deleted, like during a Docker restart
