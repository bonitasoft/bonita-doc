== Branch merge conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when changes from different branches overlap, leading to conflicts that need manual resolution.

1. To resolve these conflicts, raise a pull request for your source branch, targeting the destination branch where you intend to merge the changes.

*Example:*

If you're working on the `feature` branch and want to merge changes into `staging`, but are facing conflicts, you can raise a pull request for your `feature` branch on your Git provider, targeting the `staging` branch for merging.

2. Once the PR is created, scroll down to the bottom of the PR page:

* If the *Resolve conflicts* button is available, you can resolve conflicts directly from the pull request interface by selecting the conflicting files and making the necessary changes.
* If the *Resolve conflicts* button is disabled, you need to clone the Git repository to your local machine and resolve the conflicts using the command-line interface. If you don't want to resolve conflicts locally, you can use tools like link:https://github.com/github/dev[GitHub.dev], link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/[GitLab Web IDE] to resolve conflicts directly from your browser.

3. After resolving all conflicts in all files and ensuring that the changes are correctly edited, click on *Commit merge*, and Merge the pull request.

4. Update your Bonita UI Builder app by pulling the changes.

*Example:*

If you are facing issues merging from a `feature` branch to `staging`, then ensure you are on the `staging` branch in your Bonita UI Builder app and pull the changes there.

== Remote branch pull conflicts

These conflicts arise when changes in your local branch cannot be directly merged with changes in the remote branch. For example, If you're working on the `feature` branch and someone else pushes changes to the remote counterpart of the same branch, you may encounter conflicts if both have edited the same files.

1. Create a new branch from the conflicted branch and raise a Pull Request.

*Example:*

Create a new branch from your local `feature` branch, name it `feature-fix`, and then raise a pull request from this new branch against the original `feature` branch.

2. Once the PR is created, scroll down to the bottom of the PR page:

* If the *Resolve conflicts* button is available, you can resolve conflicts directly from the pull request interface by selecting the conflicting files and making the necessary changes.
* If the *Resolve conflicts* button is disabled, you need to clone the Git repository to your local machine and resolve the conflicts using the command-line interface. If you don't want to resolve conflicts locally, you can use tools like link:https://github.com/github/dev[GitHub.dev], link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/[GitLab Web IDE] to resolve conflicts directly from your browser.
