* **Author name**: You can update the Git author's name, which changes how your identity is displayed in the commit history.
* **Author email**: You can specify a new email address. This change affects how your contributions are linked and identified across the repository's history.

These properties become available once you've connected your app to Git. You can access these settings by clicking on the gear icon located on the bottom bar.

==== Danger zone

This section allows you to change important Git settings such as disconnecting Git from Bonita UI Builder.

===== Disconnect Git

Permanently disconnect your Bonita UI Builder app from Git.

[WARNING]
====
Once disconnected, it is not possible to reconnect to the same repository.
If you want to reconnect, you need to connect a new empty repository.
====

=== Branch

==== Default branch

For now, it's not possible to modify the default branch, which determines the base branch of your app.

==== Branch protection

For now, it's possible to set only one branch as protected to prevent changes within it.

By default, Bonita UI Builder enables the protected branch feature for the default (`master/main`) branch. This means that direct edits to this branch are restricted. To make changes, you must create a new branch, implement the changes, and then merge them into the default branch via PR.
