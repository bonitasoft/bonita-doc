* **Name**: Update the git author name to change how your identity is displayed in the commit history.
* **E-mail**: Specify a new email address to update how your commits are associated and identified in the repository history.

==== Danger Zone

This section contains critical Git settings, such as disconnecting Git from the Bonita UI Builder.

===== Disconnect Git

Permanently disconnect your Bonita UI Builder application from Git.

[WARNING]
====
Once disconnected, you will not be able to reconnect to the same repository.
To reconnect, you will need to connect to a new empty repository.

=== Branch Settings

==== Default branch

Currently, you cannot change the default branch, which determines the base branch of your application.

==== Branch protection

Currently, only one branch can be set as protected to prevent changes.

By default, Bonita UI Builder protects the default (`master/main`) branch, which means that direct changes to this branch are restricted. To make changes, create a new branch, make your updates, and then merge them into the default branch via a pull request / merge request.
