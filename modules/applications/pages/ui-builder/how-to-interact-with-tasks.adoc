:description: Discover how to interact with tasks from a Bonita UI Builder application.

{description}

* Difficulty: intermediate
* Prerequisites: have a project created on Bonita Studio with defined BDM, tasks and contracts


While Bonita UI Builder does not yet support automatic form creation from contract data, you can still easily interact with your tasks, processes, and data.

With xref:common-apis-to-use.adoc[Bonita API] and JavaScript, you can build all kind of applications that interact with your Bonita projects.

== API resources

There are mainly 2 Bonita API resources you need to interact with your tasks. To use them, open your Bonita UI Builder application, go to the `Queries` tab and create a new query to Bonita API.

=== Human tasks
The human tasks API is useful to retrieve a list of human tasks by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/bpm/humanTask?c=10&p=0&f=state=ready&f=caseId=[caseId]`

For more detailed information, refer to the {openApiUrl}/latest/#tag/HumanTask/operation/searchHumanTasks[human tasks api documentation].

=== User task execution
The user task execution API executes a task identified by its id. The task contract values have to be provided in the query's body.

For example:

    - POST | `/bonita/API/bpm/userTask/[taskId]/execution`

For more detailed information, refer to the {openApiUrl}/latest/#tag/UserTask/operation/executeUserTask[task execution api documentation].


== Manage tasks from the application

Below are examples of how you can interact with and manage your tasks from a Bonita UI Builder application.

=== Use JavaScript objects to execute tasks

Open your Bonita UI Builder application, go to the `JS` tab to create a new JavaScript object.

The code below is an example of how you can trigger different task executions, based on conditions:

[source,JS]
----
export default {
	submitCurrentTask(){
		var task;
		switch(this.currentTask.name){
			case "Assign Workspace":
				task = executeAssignWorkspaceTask; // executeAssignWorkspaceTaskthis is the POST /execution query shown in the example above
				break;
			case "Configure employee account":
				task = executeConfigEmpAccountTask;
				break;
		}
		task.run({taskId: this.currentTask.id}).then(response => {
			//refresh page
			//show alert
			//...
		}).catch((error) => {
			showAlert('fail', 'error');
		});
	},
----


=== Bind JavaScript objects to a form

Once a JavaScript object is created, you can bind it to your form. 

When the submit button is clicked, the JavaScript `submitCurrentTask` object is called:

[NOTE]
====
You don't necessarily need JavaScript objects to execute tasks. You can just create API queries and bind them to any kind of widgets. The choice is up to you.
