== Commonly used APIs

While how JS objects are designed highly depends on your need, here are the most frequently used Bonita APIs you will very likely need for your applications.

=== Session
The session API is useful for retrieving session information for the current user.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/system/session/unusedId`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Session/operation/getSession[session API documentation].

=== Users
The users API is useful for retrieving a list of users by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/identity/user?c=10&p=0&time=0&o=lastname+ASC&f=enabled=true`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/User/operation/searchUsers[users API documentation].

=== Human tasks
The human tasks API is useful to retrieve a list of human tasks by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/bpm/humanTask?c=10&p=0&f=state=ready&f=caseId=[caseId]`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/HumanTask/operation/searchHumanTasks[human tasks api documentation].

=== User task context
The user task context API provides the context for a specific user task identified by its id.

For example:

    - GET | `/bonita/API/bpm/userTask/[taskId]/context`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/UserTask/operation/getContextByUserTaskId[context by userTask id api documentation].

=== Processes
The process API is used to retrieve a list of process by applying pagination parameters and filters.

For example:

    - GET | `/bonita/API/bpm/process?c=10&p=0&f=name=[processName]&f=activationState=ENABLED` retrieves a list of specific process.
    - POST | `/bonita/API/bpm/process/[processId]/instantiation` is used to instantiate a process.

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Process/operation/searchProcesses[processes API documentation].

=== Business data
The business data is useful to find business data with pagination params and filters by invoking a `Named Query`. It allows to call either default or custom business data queries.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/bdm/businessData/com.company.hr.[businessObject]?q=[query]&p=0&c=10&f=[filterString]={filterParam}`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/BusinessDataQuery/operation/searchBusinessData[business data api documentation].

=== Professional contact data
The professional contact data is useful to retrieve the professional contact details of a user by their id.

For example:

    - GET | `/API/identity/professionalcontactdata/[userId]`

For more detailed information, refer to the link:https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/ProfessionalContactData/operation/getProfessionalContactDataById[professional contact data api documentation].

=== Group
The group api is used to retrieve a list of groups by applying pagination params and filters.

=== Upload file
The upload file api is used to upload a file of any type, typically before submitting a process or task form that includes a document in its contract.

For example:

    - POST | `/bonita/API/formFileUpload`

For information on uploading multiple files, refer to the xref:ui-builder/how-to-upload-multiple-documents.adoc[upload multiple files.]

In addition to the commonly used APIs, JS objects can also be created to meet specific application needs.
