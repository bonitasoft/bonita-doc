Discover what Bonita Studio is, as well as its main features.

== What Bonita Studio is

Bonita Studio is the central tool to design processes, data models and applications. +
It is suited for both citizen developers (business analysts, project managers, power users) and application developers, with back-end java developers working in Bonita Studio and collaborating with front-end developers working in the UI Designer. +

Bonita Studio contains a *Bonita Runtime* (Tomcat, UI Designer, Bonita Portal, Bonita Engine, and an h2 database), suitable for testing an application that is in development. +
When you run a process, it is automatically deployed onto the development platform. +

Bonita Studio is not intended for any use other than development. As a consequence, the Bonita stack embedded into the Bonita Studio can not be used for production purposes.


== Main features

* Define the xref:identity:organization-overview.adoc[organization] and xref:process:actors.adoc[actors]
* xref:ROOT:managing_extension_studio.adoc[Manage the project extensions]
* Create the application descriptors
* Launch the UI Designer to create process forms and application pages and layouts
* Plug the connectors
* Test the process execution, thanks to the embedded Tomcat and provided Bonita User Interfaces
* Configure the processes according to target environments
* Build the processes for deployment

=== Log files

In case of trouble when running Bonita Studio, you might want to take a look at log files.

Studio log file can be displayed from Bonita Studio in "Help" \-> "Show Bonita Studio log" menu.

If Studio fails to start, you can open the log file manually. File is named `.log` and is located in `<studio_folder>/workspace/.metadata` folder. +
Note that the folder might be hidden and the file might not be displayed if you choose to hide file extensions in your file manager.

=== JVM terminated. Exit code=1

*Symptom:* +
If when launching the Studio you get an error message "JVM terminated. Exit code=1" +
*Cause:* +
You may try to launch Bonita Studio with a version of the JVM that is not supported. +
*Solution:* +
See above "Configure Bonita Studio to use a specific JVM" how to force the JVM to use.

=== OutOfMemory error in Bonita Studio

*Symptom:* +
After installation, you might see an `OutOfMemory` error in Bonita Studio. +
*Cause:* +
This error sometimes occurs when importing a large process definition. +
The log messages are similar to the following:

[source,log]
----
!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.467
!ERROR Import has failed for file Autorisation Engagement Depenses-2.0.bos

!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.470
!ERROR
!STACK 0
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
----

*Solution:* +
You need to increase the memory allocated to the JVM that runs Bonita Studio. +
To do so:
  . Edit the `*.ini` file that corresponds to the executable you use to launch the Studio 
  . Modify this line: `-Xmx512m` to `-Xmx1024m` (or higher).
  . Restart Bonita Studio.

=== OutOfMemory error in Bonita Studio embedded Tomcat server

*Symptoms:* +
Long response time +
*Cause:* +
Memory issue with the default `-Xmx` used for the tomcat server because connectors used have a large amount of dependencies. +
*Potential solution:* +
Increase this value in Bonita Studio preferences \-> Server settings \-> Tomcat Maximum memory allocation. +

==== Bonita Studio installation fails due to JVM errors

A given Bonita Studio version can only run with some specifics Java versions (xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements]). +
*Symptom:* +
You encounter error messages about the JVM during the installation. +
*Potential causes:* +
Bad Java installations, or incompatibilities between a given Java version and Bitrock (Bitrock is the install builder used to install Bonita, it has the responsibility to detect the JRE used to install Bonita. Some defects on a given version could lead to incompatibility). +
*Solution:* +
First, ensure that a valid Java version is available. You can for exemple type _java -version_ on a terminal, and informations about the main Java version used will be displayed. +
If you need another version:
  . Remove the installed Java versions
  . Download the last stable build of the required Java version https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[on the Oracle website] 
  . Install it properly. 

=== java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching github-releases.githubusercontent.com found.

Bonita Studio needs to retrieve some remote assets from Github. +
*Symptom:* +
The download of those assets fails with the above exception. +
*Potential cause:* +
It may be due to an out-dated installation of Java. +
*Solution:* +
https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Install] the latest xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[supported Java] package.
