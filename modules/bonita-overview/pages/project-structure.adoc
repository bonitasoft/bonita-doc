= Project structure
:description: This page defines what the elements are within a Bonita project, as well as how some of them are structured to create a Living Application.
:page-aliases: ROOT:project-structure.adoc

This page defines the elements used to compose a Bonita project.

== Bonita project elements
Bonita projects are based on processes but also data, user interfaces, identity management and extensions.

[NOTE]
====
Using all the concepts in a project allows to take the full advantage of the Bonita platform.
However, it is not required to use all the concepts to create a valid Bonita project.

=== Living Applications
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Element |Description |Create/Provided | Tool | Alternative

|xref:applications:application-creation.adoc[Application descriptor]
|Defines the *living applications*: group of pages with a specific theme for a given user profile
|Create

|Studio or xref:applications:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[Dedicated SDK] (custom theme)
|--

|===

The concepts of Application descriptors, Application pages, layouts and themes are only used by Application. A Bonita project without applications won't use those concepts.

== Extensions
Bonita project can be extended by creating custom components. These are called extensions.

Some extensions are used to add elements to those provided while others are used to enforce the Bonita platform possibilities.

Extensions can be developed outside the Studio with your favorite IDE.

|Extension |When to use | Tool

|xref:ROOT:connectivity-overview.adoc[Connector]
|When the provided connector do not cover your requirements
|xref:ROOT:connector-archetype.adoc[Dedicated SDK]

|xref:process:actor-filtering.adoc[Actor Filter]
|When the provided actor filter do not cover your requirements
|xref:ROOT:actor-filter-archetype.adoc[Dedicated SDK]

|Theme
|When the provided theme do not cover your requirements
|xref:applications:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[Dedicated SDK]

|REST API Extension
|To interact with third party system outside processes, to make advanced BDM queries or API calls (read only)
|xref:ROOT:rest-api-extension-archetype.adoc[Dedicated SDK] or in the Studio (when Business Data is manipulated)

|Bonita provided application
|Bonita Admin application and Bonita User Application are provided by Bonitasoft and can be added or removed from applications depending on their needs.
| Available in the extensions Marketplace

|===

=== Other dependencies

In addition to the above extensions, it is possible to add any kind of third party dependencies in the classpath of the project.

Those dependencies can be added to xref:process:managing-dependencies.adoc[processes classpath, target="_blank"]. They are also added in the parent application classpath.footnote:disclaimer[Not available when using the deprecated platform mode.] It is recommended to use them to add specific extension such as xref:integration:event-handlers.adoc[Event handlers, target="_blank"], xref:runtime:engine-architecture-overview.adoc#_platform_command[Platform commands], custom Web Servlets or Filters. Since 2023.2, servlets annotations are scanned at startup when found in the classpath.

== Bonita Project Composition
Extensions are re-usable elements, they can be shared between projects.
Extensions are added to Bonita projects as Maven dependencies.

In the Studio, extensions are managed in a xref:managing-extension-studio.adoc[dedicated view].

[NOTE]
====
Even if it is possible to manually import extensions in Bonita Studio, it is highly recommended to publish your extensions on public or private maven repositories.
xref:process:connector-archetype-tutorial.adoc#_6__publish_the_connector_on_github_packages[Here] is an example on how to deploy an extension on GitHub packages.
