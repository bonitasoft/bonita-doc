= Project structure
:description: This page defines what the elements are within a Bonita Automation project, as well as how some of them are structured to create a Living Application.
:page-aliases: ROOT:project-structure.adoc

This page defines the elements used to compose a Bonita Automation project.

== Bonita Automation project elements
Bonita Automation projects are based on processes but also data, user interfaces, identity management and extensions.

[NOTE]
====
Using all the concepts in a projet allows to take the full advantage of the Bonita platform.
However, it is not required to use all the concepts to create a valid Bonita Automation project.

|Element |Description |Create/Provided | Tool | Alternative

|xref:applications:application-creation.adoc[Application descriptor]

|===

The concepts of Application descriptors, Application pages, layouts and themes are only used by Application. A Bonita Automation project without applications won't use those concepts.

== Extensions
Bonita Automation project can be extended by creating custom components. These are called extensions.

Some extensions are used to add elements to those provided while others are used to enforce the Bonita platform possibilities.

Extensions can be developed outside of the Studio with your favorite IDE.

|Extension |When to use | Tool

|When the provided connector do not cover your requirements
|xref:ROOT:connector-archetype.adoc[Dedicated SDK]

|xref:process:actor-filtering.adoc[Actor Filters]

|REST API Extension

|xref:ROOT:rest-api-extension-archetype.adoc[Dedicated SDK] or in the Studio (when Business Data is manipulated)

|===

== Bonita Project Composition
Extensions are re-usable elements, they can be shared between projects.
Extensions are added to Bonita Automation projects as Maven dependencies.

In the Studio, extensions are managed in a xref:ROOT:managing_extension_studio.adoc[dedicated view].

[NOTE]
====
Even if it is possible to manually import extensions in Bonita Studio, it is highly recommended to publish your extensions on public or private maven repositories.
xref:process:connector-archetype-tutorial#_6_publish_the_connector_on_github_packages[Here] is an example on how to deploy an extension on Github packages.
