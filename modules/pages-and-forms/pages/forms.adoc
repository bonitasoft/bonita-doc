== Create a form

In a Bonita project architecture, xref:forms.adoc[forms] are embedded in the pools. Their creation is very linked to the process step they "feed", in a way. +
It is recommended to define the xref:data:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[contract] in its _Execution / Contract_ property tab before to create the form, so the Studio will generate a form according to the contract. +
Forms can be created at different level:

* An instantiation form is created from the pool _Execution / Instantiation form_ tab
* A task form is created from the human task _Execution / form_ tab

The Case overview (this page is technically considered as a form because of its strong link to the process) is created from the pool _Execution / Overview page_ tab and does not need a contract to be created.

. From these tabs, click on the *_Edit_* icon at the right of the _Target form_ field. This opens the UI Designer on a new form, with some widgets, containers, and variables already created to speed up the design process, using the contract inputs.
. Rename it
. Customize what needs to be displayed as well as the _Target URL on success_ of the *_Submit_* button.


Most of the time, they are used in only one process; in this case, they are packaged with the process and deployed in the _Processes_ section of Bonita User Application. They can be viewed in the process details section.
Alternatively, they can be used in several processes. In this case, they can be managed as xref:ROOT:resource-management.adoc[_Resources_] in Bonita Administrator Application.

== Instantiation form

When it is submitted, a case (process instance) is created. +
At development time, an auto-generated form is provided by default, to ease process logic testing and debugging. +
It is based on the relevant contract. +
A custom form must be developed for user testing and production environments.

== Human Task execution form

When it is submitted, the human task is executed. +
At development time, an auto-generated form is provided by default, to ease process logic testing and debugging. +
It is based on the relevant contract. +
A custom form must be developed for user testing and production environments.

== Case overview form

It gives the chronological evolution of the case, the current values for Business data as well as documents. +
At development time, an auto-generated form is provided by default. It can also be used in Non-Production or Production environments.

== Use in processes

Most of the time, processes embed their forms in the .bar generated from Bonita Studio and deployed to a Bonita Runtime.
Rarely, when a form is used by multiple processes, it can be deployed as a "Resource" in Bonita Administrator Application.

== Live update

xref:runtime:live-update.adoc[Live update] allows the Administrator to update one element of the application in a situation of emergency. +
You can xref:runtime:live-update.adoc#form-list[update the form in the list] and xref:runtime:live-update.adoc#form-mapping[modify the mapping with the process]. +
You can also xref:ROOT:resource-management.adoc#modify[edit] a global form as a resource in Bonita Administrator Application.

== Forms Development

There are some extra things to consider when creating a form compared with a page, namely how data is passed between the process instance and the form.

== Form sources

Starting with Bonita 7.X, you are recommended to use xref:bonita-overview:ui-designer-overview.adoc[Bonita UI Designer] to create forms for Bonita processes. +
Bonita UI Designer forms enable you to take full advantage of the separation between the process definition and the UI definition, by using contracts.

You can also use external forms referenced by URL. If an external URL is being used, the information submitted to the Engine by the form must fulfill the contract.
You can store external forms wherever you want as long as they are accessible by URL.

For certain cases, you can specify that there is no form. This is required for a process that is instantiated programmatically (by a call activity or by an API call from an application, for example), or for a process or a task that does not have any contract input. +
A human task with no form and no contract represents a manual task completed outside Bonita. The user will indicate in the application that the manual task is complete. A process or a human task with a contract but no form expects the information needed to fulfill the contract to be provided programmatically.

[CAUTION]
====
Bonita 7.8 does not support 6.x GWT forms and case overview pages, neither for design nor at runtime.
To migrate your processes still using them, follow those xref:ROOT:migrate-a-form-from-6-x.adoc[instructions]

== Form types

A xref:data:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[context] is the set of data provided by the process instance or task instance to the form. There is no context for a process instantiation form.

A xref:data:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[contract] is the definition of that data that the form returns to the process instance. There is no contract for an overview form.

== Testing and debugging

During process development, some temporary forms are generated if necessary when you run a process from Bonita Studio, for process instantiation, for human task execution, and for the case overview. These forms are generated if the "UI Designer" option is chosen but no form is specified in the process definition.
The process instantiation and step execution temporary forms are based on the relevant contract and they are a useful tool for testing and debugging your application.

== Case overview

The case overview contains three main sections:

* List of business data: the content of the business variables used by the case
* List of documents: the content of each document used by the case
* Timeline: information in chronological order about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case
