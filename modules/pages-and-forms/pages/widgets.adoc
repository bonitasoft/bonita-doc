:description: The UI Designer provides a set of default widgets that you can use or customize to design a page or form.

{description}

[NOTE]
====
Difference exist between a page and a form, but the procedure for designing them is the same.
This documentation uses the term _page_ for both pages and forms, unless otherwise stated.
====

A page consists of widgets that are arranged in rows, and optionally, containers.
The UI Designer provides a set of default widgets that you can use to design a page. The default widgets are available from the palette panel, which is on the left side of the Page editor. A widget has properties that control how it appears and how it is used. There are some general properties that all widgets have, and some properties that are specific to the widget type. You can also create xref:custom-widgets.adoc[custom widgets].
Each widget in the palette has a description. To show a widget description, just roll over the widget in the palette.

[#file-viewer]

== File viewer widget

image::images/widgets/fileviewer.png[fileviewer,align="left"]

Use the file viewer widget to preview or download a file or a process document in any UI Designer artifact (page or form for instance).
You can display a document in a modal dialog box or directly in a page.

The previewable documents are limited to documents supported by the end user browser (by default pdf and images on usual browsers). Documents that are not previewable are prompted to be downloaded.

[WARNING]
====

*:fa-exclamation-triangle:* If you create a custom FileViewer: edit the `box-viewer.directive.js` file from the custom widget editor, and replace `pbFileViewer` by the name of your custom FileViewer prefixed by `custom` (for instance `customFileViewerSmart`).
Limitation: adding several types of `FileViewer` in a page is not supported.

[#rich-text-area]

== Rich Text Area widget

image::images/widgets/rich-text-area.png[rich-text-area,align="left"]

Use the rich text area widget to edit HTML formatted text in any UI Designer artifact (page or form for instance).

You can add rich text area inputs for end users to create text to be exported in HTML format for integration on emails, etc. +
It can be prefilled with an HTML template.

A options toolbar exposed to end users can be customized and localized with the usual xref:ROOT:multi-language-pages.adoc[localization mechanism] (localization.json file).

== "Widget actions" Menu

From the properties panel header, the "Widget actions" menu provides a list of actions for the selected widget.

* Use *view* menu option to view the code of the standard widget in the widget editor.
From there, you can clone this widget (to modify or extend it) by clicking on *Save as*. This will create a custom widget that you can modify as needed.
* Use *edit* menu option to edit the widget in the widget editor (custom widget only).
* Use the *switch* menu option to replace a widget by another one and keep the current configuration.

In this wizard, select or type the widget to switch to, then click *Show properties*.

Whenever possible, properties in the source widgets are mapped with same properties in the target widget.

You can edit that or map more, then click on *Switch*.

When the switch is completed, you still may have to set properties from the properties panel.
