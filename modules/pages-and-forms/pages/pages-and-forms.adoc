== User Interfaces development overview

Your automation project can use xref:ROOT:pages.adoc[pages] to display information and provide interaction controls to the end-users or administrators. +
It most of the times uses xref:forms.adoc[forms] to display and collect new or edited information. +
Forms and pages are made of containers and widgets. +
Some containers and widgets can be grouped in xref:ROOT:fragments.adoc[fragments], in order to be reused in several pages or forms. +

The overall graphical structure of the application is handled by the xref:applications:layout-development.adoc[layout]. +
The look and feel of the application, layout, forms, and pages is handled by the xref:ROOT:themes.adoc[theme].

Forms are embedded in the processes, whereas pages, layouts, and themes are referred to in the application descriptor. +

Bonita provides a default theme, available in Bonita Studio and Bonita Runtime. +
Developers can xref:applications:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[create a custom theme] using their favorite development environment, and then add it as an xref:software-extensibility:software-extensibility.adoc[extension] in the project. +

Bonita UI Designer comes with a set of xref:ROOT:widgets.adoc[provided containers and widgets]. +
xref:custom-widgets.adoc[Custom widgets] can also be created to make the palette richer. +
Those are developped by professional developers, from scratch or from an https://community.bonitasoft.com/project[existing project] of the Community. +

The following chapters give more information on how to develop all the others elements in the UI Designer.

== Responsiveness

You can optimize the page or form design for a given device type by configuring xref:ROOT:widget-properties.adoc[device-specific values for the Width property] for widgets. Use the a device types bar in the Page editor to choose the target device type.

== Modify an element

After a form, page, layout, or fragment is created, you can update it by just clicking on the *_Pencil_* icon to open it in the editor. +
Update the element by deleting or dragging and dropping widgets, business objects or fragments from the palette to the whiteboard. +
Edit widget properties in the widget properties panel, create data, and bind them to the widgets.

== Preview an element

You can preview page, form and fragment rendering by clicking on the *_Preview_* button. Another browser window opens with the element as it will be displayed after deployment. If you update the page, form or fragment, the preview is automatically refreshed when you save. +

You can display your page, layout, form or fragment with one of your theme application installed. +

From the preview window, you can also expand the preview outside of current preview mechanism, with the *Expand Preview in new window* button. This allows you to set new URL parameters, play with dynamic browser sizing, and to reuse same url in another browser to see how your form or page behaves in your user default browser. +

You can use the a device types bar on the preview screen to choose the target device type. +
The preview displays the element as it would be displayed on the selected type of device. +

[#export]

== Export an element

You can export a page or a layout to deploy it in Bonita Admin Application as a custom page. +
You can export any element to import it into another UI Designer. +

To export an element, click the *_Export_* button image:images/images-6_0/pb-export.png[Export button] on the Page editor or the UI Designer home page. A zip file is downloaded to your computer. It contains a Bonita custom page, which is also suitable for import into another UI Designer. +

After export you can modify your page or layout code by directly editing the code located in _resources_ folder. Be aware that such a modification to the code will work when the page or layout is deployed in the Bonita Runtime, but it may be broken if you import the page into another UI Designer.

To import elements in another Studio, you can export pages and forms in the process `.bos` file. In the list of elements to insert in the .bos file, forms are checked by default, but not pages. When you import this `.bos` file into another Bonita Studio, forms and pages that you have checked are available in the UI Designer of that Studio.

[#import]

== Import an element

To import an element from another UI Designer, go to the UI Designer home page and click the *_Import_* button image:images/images-6_0/pb-import.png[Import button]. When you import a page, layout, form or fragment, its dependencies (such as custom widgets and fragments used) are automatically be imported too. +

[WARNING]
====
An element that has not been designed with the UI Designer cannot be imported into the UI Designer.
====

== Pages and forms in .bos/.bar file

When you generate the `.bar` file of a process, the mapped forms created with the UI Designer are embedded in the file. +
Application pages are not embedded as they are independant from the process. +
When the .bar file is deployed, forms are deployed too. +

Applications and its elements must be deployed onto the target environment. This can be done manually from the Super Administrator or Administrator applications, in the *_Applications_* and *_Resources_* menu options. It can also be done automatically through the automation of the project builds and deployment.
