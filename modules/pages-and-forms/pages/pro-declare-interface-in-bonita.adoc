== Declare the interface in Bonita application descriptor

The xref:applications:application-creation.adoc[Bonita application descriptor] is a file that let you describe all your applications.

To declare a Bonita UI Designer Pro interface in it, you need to edit it in Studio using the "source" tab.
In this tab, you will be able to declare your application built and packaged with Bonita UI Designer Pro, using auto-completion with a "advancedApplication" XML node.

In this example, the "Advanced Overview" application is declared with node:

[source,xml]
----
    <advancedApplication token="advanced" version="1.0" profile="User" state="ACTIVATED">
        <displayName>Advanced Overview</displayName>
    </advancedApplication>
----

There are fewer properties to set for an advanced application than for a legacy application, but the "displayName" is still mandatory.

Full form edition support will come in a future release.
