How to log in or log out of the Bonita Portal.

You can also switch between users with different rights,(e.g. user profile and admin profile), to access different management menus.

NOTE: to avoid login problems, make sure you empty your browser cache http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache[Empty your cache for different browsers]

== How to log in as a user

If for example, you receive an email with a link to start a case or a task in the Bonita Portal, you will need to log in.

* Enter the login page url, `+http://hostname:port/bonita/+`, to get to the login page as a user. The default port number is 8080.
* In the user field, enter the *login*, and the *password* for this user.
* Click on the *_Login button_*.

== How to log out and log back in as another user

* Go to the *_Tool bar_* at the top of the interface.
* Go to *username* menu (your username in the top right of the screen) and choose *_Logout_*.
* This will log you out and then display the *login form*.
* In the user field, enter the *name* of a different user, enter the *password* for this user.
* Click on the *_Login button_*.

Logging out will send the user back to the login page.

NOTE: in a system that uses CAS to provide single sign-on, the administrator can remove the logout option. In this case, to log out of the portal you must log out of the CAS system or close your browser.
