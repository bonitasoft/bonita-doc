= Bonita BPM Studio installation

This page explains how to install Bonita BPM Studio for developing processes. There are installer wizards for Windows, Linux, and Mac systems, and an OS-independent archive that can be installed on any system.

== Prerequisites

Check the xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements].

Before you download Bonita BPM Studio, make sure that you know whether you are using a using a 32 or 64-bit system, and that you have the appropriate Java version installed:

* For Linux, to find out whether you are using a 32 or 64 bit Linux, run the following command: `getconf LONG_BIT`, which returns either 32 or 64.
* For Windows, see the http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows[32 and 64 bit Windows FAQ].
* For Mac, 32-bit Java is no longer supported, so there is no 32-bit version of Bonita BPM for Mac systems.

 danger
Both Windows and Mac have default security settings that will prevent execution of Bonita BPM. See below for further details about what you can do to bypass those security protections


*Note for users of macOS 10.12.x and above* : There is an known issue on macOS Sierra and Java about the slowness of   java.net.InetAddress getLocalHost() which results in a slowness of the Bonita Studio (find more info on https://thoeni.io/post/macos-sierra-java/[thoeni] or https://plumbr.eu/blog/java/macos-sierra-problems-with-java-net-inetaddress-getlocalhost[plumbr]). To resolve this issue you shoud add your computer name to your /etc/hosts file : In a terminal, edit your `/etc/hosts` with sudo privilege, add your computer name to the local IP addresses `127.0.0.1 localhost <mycomputername.local>` and `::1 localhost <mycomputername.local>` (To find your macOS computer name, look at https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25076[Apple support dedicated page]).

*Note for users of OS X 10.12.x and above using Zip installation* : a new security feature has been added in MacOS Sierra about the _App Translocation_ prevents the launch of software that is not officially signed by Apple (see https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/OSXv10.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017145-SW1[Apple official site] and https://eclecticlight.co/2016/06/16/macos-sierra-will-break-many-installers-and-updaters/[other dedicated site]). +
In order to launch Bonita BPM Studio on a system running on MacOS Sierra or above, you must apply extended attributs manually: In a terminal, run `xattr -rc BonitaBPMCommunity.app` for Community edition, or `xattr -rc BonitaBPMSubscription.app` for Subscription edition.

*Note for users of OS X 10.7.5 and above*: a new security feature called *Gatekeeper* prevents the installation of software that is not officially recognized by Apple. +
For more information and details of how to install Bonita BPM Studio on a system running Gatekeeper, see the https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491[Apple support site].

*Not for users of Windows 10*: the security feature called *SmartScreen* prevents execution of Bonita BPM Studio installer.  When you get the "Windows protect your PC" pop up window, click on "More info" link and click on "Run anyway" button.

== Troubleshooting

[discrete]
==== Log files

In case of trouble when running Bonita BPM Studio, you might want to take a look at log files.

Studio log file can be displayed from Bonita BPM Studio in "Help" \-> "Show Bonita BPM Studio log" menu.

If Studio fails to start, you can open the log file manually. File is named `.log` and is located in `<studio_folder>/workspace/.metadata` folder. +
Note that folder might be hidden and file might not be displayed if you choose to hide file extensions in your file manager.

==== OutOfMemory error in Bonita BPM Studio

After installation, you might see an `OutOfMemory` error in Bonita BPM Studio. +
This error sometimes occurs when importing a large process definition. +
The log messages are similar to the following:

[source,log]
----
!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.467
!ERROR Import has failed for file Autorisation Engagement Depenses-2.0.bos

!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.470
!ERROR
!STACK 0
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
----

To fix this issue, you need to increase the memory allocated to the JVM that runs Bonita BPM Studio.

Edit the `*.ini` file that corresponds to the executable you use to launch the Studio (e.g. `BonitaBPMSubscription64.ini` if you run BonitaBPMSubscription64.exe) and modify this line: `-Xmx512m` to `-Xmx1024m` (or higher).

Then restart Bonita BPM Studio.

==== Bonita Studio Welcome page stays blank on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

If the Welcome page displays fully white when you start-up your Bonita Studio: +

just install the missing packet libwebkitgtk by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0-0
----

Then the welcome page should display well, like this: +
