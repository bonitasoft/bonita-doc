Bonita is an opensource Digital Process Automation platform, you can therefore build Bonita Community edition from the source.

== Prerequisites

All source code of Bonita solution is available from the https://github.com/bonitasoft[Bonitasoft GitHub organization]. Each component of the solution has a dedicated repository (e.g. https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine[Engine repository]).

To build the product, you need the following:

* Internet connection
* Git
* JDK 1.8 or above
* Apache Maven 3.3.9 (version is mandatory)

====

We provide build script for Linux only. Therefore it is recommended to use Linux. If you don't have Linux you can either use a virtual machine or port the build script to Mac.

== Building Bonita

In order to build Bonita you need to use the script provided in https://github.com/Bonitasoft-Community/Build-Bonita[Build Bonita] GitHub project. Use the branch of the project that match the version you want to build.

Simply run `bash build-script-7.4.1.sh` and provide required information.

A script is used because some components rely on components that are built earlier in the sequence, so the build order must be respected.
