= Restore the default Look & Feel

Restoring default Look & Feel in case of errors

NOTE:
*Note:* For Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions only.


Normally, the Look & Feel for Bonita Portal and for process forms is xref:managing-look-feel.adoc[managed using Bonita Portal]. However, it is also possible to restore the default Look & Feel using the Bonita Engine API.
This provides an "escape" in case a Look & Feel that contains errors that make the Bonita Portal unusable is applied.

The default and active Look & Feels are stored in the Bonita Engine database. The Look & Feel is managed by the `ThemeAPI`.

To restore the default Look & Feel with the API, use the `getDefault` method to get the default Look & Feel from the Engine database,
then call `updateTheme` to load it into the portal.

For example:
`
getThemeAPI().restoreDefaultTheme(ThemeType.PORTAL);
`
