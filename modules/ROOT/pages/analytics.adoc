Optionally, a properties file can be added if the report is localized in different languages.

. Select the report that you want to export.
. Click on the _More_ button.

== Manage Japanese PDF reports

Japanese language support for reports is not provided by default.
In order to display the Japanese translations in the default PDF reports, you need to download the Japanese translation `my_report_ja_jp.properties` file from http://translate.bonitasoft.org/[Crowdin].
If the tenant is deployed and your report has been displayed, open the directory of the report in the Bonita Home folder
(`bonita/client/tenants/`_`yourTenantId`_`/work/reports/`_`yourReport`_).
Then add your "ja_jp.properties" translation files to this directory.
If your report has never been displayed, go to your deployed war or ear > `WEB-INF\classes` then edit your report zip file to add the Japanese properties file.
