== Purpose

A report presents the Administrator with data about the usage of cases and tasks in processes.

There are four reports available by default:

* Case average time - export in .pdf
* Case list - export in .pdf
* Task list - export in .pdf
* Case history - export in .csv

You can also xref:reporting-overview.adoc[define] and <<install,install a custom report>>. For example, you could define a report to track purchase order progress.

== Manage Japanese PDF reports

Japanese language support for reports is not provided by default.
In order to display the Japanese translations in the default PDF reports, you need to download the Japanese translation `my_report_ja_jp.properties` file from http://translate.bonitasoft.org/[Crowdin].
If the tenant is deployed and your report has been displayed, open the directory of the report in the Bonita Home folder
(`bonita/client/tenants/`_`yourTenantId`_`/work/reports/`_`yourReport`_).
Then add your "ja_jp.properties" translation files to this directory.
If your report has never been displayed, go to your deployed war or ear > `WEB-INF\classes` then edit your report zip file to add the Japanese properties file.
