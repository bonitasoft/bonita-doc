= User activation / deactivation

Activation / deactivation of a user allows to revoke any access to the platform without
deleting the user.

If a user is deactivated, the user cannot log in to Bonita Portal. However, all their past actions are kept
intact and can be displayed.

NOTE:
The Administrator cannot add a membership to a deactivated user.
In consequence, the *Add membership button* is not displayed for a deactivated user.
