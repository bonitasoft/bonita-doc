Activation / deactivation of a user allows to revoke any access to the Runtime, without deleting the user. +
If a user is deactivated, they cannot log into the Bonita Runtime. However, all their past actions are kept intact and can be displayed.

[NOTE]

The Administrator cannot add a membership to a deactivated user.
In consequence, the _Add membership_ button is not displayed for an inactive user.
