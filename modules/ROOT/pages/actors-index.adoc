= Actors 
:description: Actors are indirections between the processes and entities of the organization. They are used to define the candidates who can perform a given human task.

Actors are indirections between the processes and entities of the organization. They are used to define the candidates who can perform a given human task. +

_"The user who performed the previous task"_ or _"The manager of the user who did the previous human task"_ are actors too ; but since they are not directly linked to the organization, they are called "Actor filters". +

Technically, they have the same structure than connectors. Bonita provides some actor filters, and developers can create their own. +
