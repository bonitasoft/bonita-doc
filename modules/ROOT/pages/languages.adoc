Instructions below explain how to add a language to Bonita BPM Portal. Steps below involve using content created by Bonitasoft community and therefore not officially supported.

. Go to http://translate.bonitasoft.org/[Bonita BPM translation project].
. Select the language you are interested in.
. Make sure you click on the "Toggle Hidden Files" button image:images/crowdin_toggle_hidden_files.png[Toggle hidden files button] to see already fully translated files.
. Browse the file tree to `+{varVersion}.x/bonita-web/portal+` folder.
. For each file in the folder: open it and in the *_File_* menu click on *_Download_*. Each `.po/.pot` file has a language indicator and a locale indicator. For example, the files for the Brazilian Portuguese language end with `pt_BR.po`.
. For Subscription editions, you also need to get the files from `+{varVersion}.x/bonita-web-sp/portal+` folder.
. Copy all the `.po/.pot` files to a new folder of your choice, preferably in a sub-folder inside your bundle. E.g. `[TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER]/i18n/`. For Bonita BPM Studio, Tomcat installation folder is located in `workspace/tomcat`.
. Declare a new JVM property "org.bonitasoft.i18n.folder" and set the value to the full path to `i18n` folder:
 ** For Tomcat embedded in Bonita BPM Studio edit the appropriate *.ini* file (e.g. *BonitaBPMCommunity64.ini* for Windows 64bit) and use the following syntax: `-Dtomcat.extra.params="-Dorg.bonitasoft.i18n.folder=C:\path\to_i18n\folder"`
 ** For Tomcat on Windows edit *setenv.bat*
 ** For Tomcat on Linux edit *setenv.sh*
 ** For JBoss on Windows edit *standalone.conf.bat*
 ** For JBoss on Linux edit *standalone.conf*
. Restart your application server (or restart Bonita BPM Studio). The next time Bonita BPM Portal starts, it will detect the new language and add it to the list in the *Settings* menu.
