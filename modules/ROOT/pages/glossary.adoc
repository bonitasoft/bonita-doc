:description: List of important keywords used in the documentation to better understand the main Bonita concepts.

[caption="Work in Progress"]
CAUTION: This glossary is a work in progress. It does not include all the terms in Bonita documentation.

== A

Actor filter::
Filters users that can access a human task in a process.

Application descriptor::
Defines the Living Application: group of pages with a specific theme for a given user profile.

ApplicationLink::
Tag used to describe an Application made with Bonita UI Builder in the Studioâ€™s Application descriptor.

== B

BDM Access Control::
Defines rules to protect the access to the Business Data Model (BDM) through REST API calls via a white list mechanism.

Business Data Model::
Business Data Model (sometimes abbreviated _BDM_) is the structure of the business data used by your processes.

Bonita Engine::
Bonita Engine is at the core, responsible for process execution.

Bonita Platform::
Bonita Platform is composed of two components : Bonita Studio and Bonita Runtime. Its purpose is to create, build and run projects.

Bonita Project::
A Bonita Project represent the file structure of sources required to construct an application (e.g. Process diagrams, BDM, Application descriptors, UID pages and forms...). A project needs to be built to produce an executable binary. It uses Maven under the hood and should be pushed in a Git repository to leverage collaboration, reliability and build automation. Bonita Project are created from Bonita Studio. Several Bonita Projects can belong in a Studio workspace.

Bonita Runtime::
Bonita Runtime is dedicated to operate automation projects. It is composed of one or more nodes. A Bonita Runtime composed of multiple nodes constitutes a cluster to ensure High Availability and High Performance.

Bonita Studio::
Bonita Studio contains all the elements needed to develop and build a project. It is a desktop application based on Eclipse IDE.

Bonita UI Builder::
Bonita UI Builder (sometimes abbreviated UIB) is a development environment used for creating all kind on interfaces, whether they are pages or forms or else, that make up an Application. It is a web-based tool that is launched from a Bonitasoft custom docker image.

Bonita UI Designer::
Bonita UI Designer (sometimes abbreviated UID) is a development environment used for creating pages and forms that make up a Living Application. It is a web-based tool that is launched from Bonita Studio. 

== C

Connector::
Automates external services interaction from within processes.

== D

Diagram::
BPMN diagram that describes your business processes.

== E

Extensions::
Extensions are custom components used to add elements to those provided while others are used to enforce the Bonita platform possibilities. An extension can be an Actor filter, a Connector, a REST API Extension or a Theme. Extensions can be developed outside the Studio with your favorite IDE.

== F

Form::
Web interfaces to interact with processes (to instantiate a process and for human tasks).

== L

Layout::
Used to define the main frame of a Living Application.

Living Application::
A Living Application is a navigation of pages that can be accessed by a Profile. It is created and operated within Bonita Platform.

== O

Organization::
The definition of the user base that will use the processes (includes users, roles and groups).

== P

Pages::
Web pages used within your applications.

== R

REST API Extension::
To interact with third party system outside processes, to make advanced BDM queries or API calls (read only).

== S

Storage & persistence::
Bonita Runtime requires a storage to operate. The storage is composed of two databases: one for core services and one dedicated to Business Data.

== T

Theme::
Defines the look and feel of your application.

== W

Workspace::
A workspace is a directory where Bonita Studio stores files such as Studio configuration settings (shared by all projects in the workspace) and projects folders.
