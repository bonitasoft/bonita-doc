= Profiles management in Bonita Administration Application
:description: This page explains what a user with the Administrator profile can do with profiles in Bonita Administrator Application.

This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile can do with profiles in xref:admin-application-overview.adoc[Bonita Administrator Application].

In all Bonita editions, Administrators can change the mapping between a provided profile (User and Administrator) and the organization entities (user, groups, roles, and memberships). +
In Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, there is one more provided profile: Process Manager.
In Enterprise, Performance, and Efficiency editions, Administrators can also create new profiles and edit them.

Here is a view of this page:

== View profile and profile mappings

In _Organization_/_Profiles_, the list shows all profiles sorted by alphabetical order:

* Three provided profiles: "User", "Administrator", and for subscription editions,"Process Manager"
These profiles are marked in the list by a "Bonita" icon at the far right of the profile row. This means that they cannot be deleted nor renamed.
* All custom profiles created, for Enterprise, Performance, and Efficiency editions

To view the mapping of the profile with the entities of the organization, in the row of the profile, click on the _Show mapping with organization_ icon.

== Export a profile

It may happen that the Administrator needs to export a profile, to reimport it in a Bonita Studio or install it on another Bonita Administrator Application.
To do so:

. Go to _Organization_>__Profiles__
. In the row of the profile to export, click on the _Export profile_ icon
. Confirm the exportation in the file browser

== Live Update

The Administrator can xref:live-update.adoc[Live Update] a profile:

* create a custom profile (not available in Community nor Teamwork editions)
* delete a custom profile (same)
* edit the name and description (only for custom profile)
* edit the mapping (all editions, all profiles)

This is only in case of an issue to solve temporarily. We strongly encourage the modification of the organization and profiles to be conducted
in Bonita Studio so it can be shared and versioned with the whole project.

=== Add a profile (import or create)

To do so:

. Go to _Organization_>__Profiles__
. Click on the _Add_ button

 To create:

To import:
[NOTE]
====

It is possible to import a profile file made of several profiles. The file is imported and checked. If one profile is corrupted, none of the profiles will be added and an error message is displayed.
*Note*: The default profiles defined in Bonita have the flag `isDefault` set to "True" in the XML file. If it is changed for any profile, an error message is displayed upon importation.
====

 .. Click in the "Profiles XML file" field
