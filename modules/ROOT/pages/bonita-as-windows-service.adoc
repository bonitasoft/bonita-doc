= How to install Bonita as a service on Windows
:description: In this tutorial we show how to install Tomcat with Bonita configured as a windows service.

In this tutorial we show how to install Tomcat with Bonita configured as a windows service.

== Software needed

For this tutorial you will need the following softwares:

* Tomcat
* Bonita Tomcat Bundle
* Postgresql Database (or another database supported by Bonita)

Please verify the supported version from the Support page

== Download and installation

* *_Download_* apache-tomcat-x.y.exe from Tomcat website: https://tomcat.apache.org/
* *_Install_* apache-tomcat-x.y.exe. From now on we'll call the installation path as %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%
* *_Verify_* that Tomcat is well installed browsing the following URL: http://localhost:8080

* *_Download_* the bundle BonitaSubscription-x.y.z-tomcat.zip (or BonitaCommunity-x.y.z-tomcat.zip for the community edition)
* *_Unzip_* the bundle in a folder that we'll call: %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%
* *_Move_* the setup tool %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/setup into another folder, for example %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/setup
This last step is not mandatory since the setup tool is independent from Tomcat, you can place it wherever you want.

== Get the license (In case of Subscription edition)

* *_Execute_* %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/tools/request_key_utils/generateRequestKey.bat
* *_Use_* the generated key to get a license from the Customer Service Center. The license should not be a development license.
* *_Move_* the received license file into the folder %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/setup/platform_conf/licenses

== Database configuration

* *_Configure_* the file %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/setup/database.properties to point towards the suited database (engine and BDM)

* *_Add_* the database driver here: %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/setup/lib
Check your Database provider documentation in order to get the proper driver version.
* *_Execute_* the command "%TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/setup/setup.bat init" in order to initialize the Bonita database with the default configuration.
* *_Verify_* that the tables in the engine database are properly created.

== Server configuration

* *_Move_* the folder %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/server/lib/bonita to %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/lib
* *_Add_* your database driver to %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/lib
* *_Move_* the folder %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/server/conf to %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/conf
* *_Move_* the application %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/server/webapps/bonita.war to %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/webapps
* *_Configure_* %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/conf/Catalina/localhost/bonita.xml

== Configure JVM properties

* The file %TOMCAT_BUNDLE%/server/bin/setenv.bat contains all JVM parameters to use in the new installation.
* The properties should be the following ones:
 ** -Dorg.bonitasoft.platform.setup.folder=C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat x.y\setup
 ** -Dorg.bonitasoft.engine.incident.folder=C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat x.y\logs
 ** -Dsysprop.bonita.db.vendor=postgres
 ** -Dsysprop.bonita.bdm.db.vendor=postgres
 ** -Dcom.arjuna.ats.arjuna.common.propertiesFile=C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat x.y\conf\jbossts-properties.xml
 ** -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

where we replaced the %CATALINA_HOME% with our new Tomcat directory

In order to apply these configurations to the new installation, you have to use the program %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/bin/TomcatXw.exe (Where X is the Tomcat major version), and replicate them in the java tab.

* Setup %TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER%/bin/Tomcat8w.exe \-> Java \-> "Initial memory" with a proper value based on your hardware and project requirements.
* Do the same with "Maximum Memory pool" property.
As an example, if your Operating system has 8 GB of ram you could setup Initial Memory Pool = Maximum Memory Pool = 4096.
* Verify that in the Startup tab the "Mode" property is set to "Jvm".

== System restart and test

* Restart the Tomcat service to take in account the new updates.
* Verify that the Bonita portal is available at the following address:
http://localhost:8080/bonita
* Connect with the technical user (default install/install) and do some tests:
 ** Add an organization.
 ** Assign profiles to users.
 ** Deploy a simple process and test its execution.
