= Overview of the organization in Bonita Portal

In Bonita Portal, a user with the Administrator profile can view all the parts of an organization.

In practice, this includes:

* the parent groups
* child groups
* the number and list of users in a group
* the manager of each user
* the email address of a user
* the date and time of the user's last login
* the roles and the number of users with that role

The Administrator has the rights to:

* xref:import-export-an-organization.adoc[import an organization exported from Bonita Studio]
* xref:import-export-an-organization.adoc[export an organization from Bonita Portal]
* xref:group.adoc[create and delete groups]
* xref:role.adoc[create and delete roles]
* xref:manage-a-user.adoc[create and manage users] and manage memberships

*Developer environment:* When you are testing a process locally by running it from Bonita Studio, the default organization defined in the Studio is *automatically published* to the Bonita Portal.

*Production environment:* When you first launch Bonita Portal in a Production environment, there is *no default organization*.
You must xref:first-steps-after-setup.adoc[create a user with the Administrator profile]. This user can than create and manage the organization.
