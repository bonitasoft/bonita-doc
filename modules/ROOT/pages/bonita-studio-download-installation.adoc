{description}

== Bonita Studio download

=== Prerequisites

Check the xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements].

==== MacOs specific prerequisites

[IMPORTANT]
====
For users of macOS Big Sur 11.0 and above: Only version 7.11.4 and upwards are compatible
====

Only *installed JDK* are accepted by the macOS _gatekeeper_. +
If you try to use a JDK directly downloaded, you will get this kind of error: _jdk-11.0.5 can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer._ +
The solution is to use an installer to install properly the JDK. The easiest way is to tape the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Install brew first if it is not installed yet, more details here: https://brew.sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Use brew to install a JDK
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew cask install java11
----

Another solution is to download and execute manually the installer, https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html[here for example].

==== Windows specific note

[NOTE]
====
When Bonita Studio starts, various tasks are executed in the background, such as the embedded Bonita test server startup (including Bonita Engine initialization), Bonita test organization deployment, and more. This behavior can be configured in the https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita//bonita-bpm-studio-preferences[preferences] +
This might take a while and some features may not be immediately available. +
When those operations are completed, a notification pops up on your Bonita Studio welcome page.
