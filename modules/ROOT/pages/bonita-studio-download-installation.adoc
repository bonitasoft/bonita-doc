When Bonita Studio starts, various tasks are executed in the background, such as the embedded Bonita test server startup (including Bonita Engine initialization), Bonita test organization deployment, and more.
This might take a while and some features may not be immediately available. A pop-up window will appear to indicate you can update the Bonita server configuration in https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita//bonita-bpm-studio-preferences[preferences] image:images/getting-started-tutorial/installation/studio-first-start-03-starting-bonita-server-popup.png[Bonita Studio Server starting pop-up]

When the Bonita Engine is started, you will see a confirmation pop-up on your Bonita Studio welcome page.
