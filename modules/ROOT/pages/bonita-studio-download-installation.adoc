* Windows: `BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y-x86_64.exe`
* macOS: `BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y-x86_64.dmg`
* Linux: `BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y-x86_64.tar.gz`

To download the latest version of Bonita Studio Subscription edition, go to the https://customer.bonitasoft.com/download/request[Customer Service Center] and request the download of the version you need.

=== Installation using a wizard

To run the installer for Windows, macOS or Linux, double-click on the file you downloaded. +

Then follow the installation wizard through to the end of the installation procedure:

. Select installation language: this will be used for the installation process
. Welcome message: click on *Next*
. License agreement: you need to accept this to continue
. Installation directory: make sure the path is quite short and the directory is empty
  The default installation directories are:
         * Windows: `C:\BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y`
         * macOS: `/Applications/BonitaStudioCommunity-x.y`
. Confirmation that installation is about to start: click on "Next"
. Actual installation: wait a little bit
. License request. For the Subscription edition only. If you do not have your licence file ready, you can skip that; Bonita Studio will request the license at first start.
. You'll see a confirmation message that offers the option to start Bonita Studio. Choose to launch Bonita Studio and click on *Finish*
. A "thank you for downloading" page will be displayed in your web browser, with important getting starting information.

=== Linux archive

Since 2024.1, the Linux binaries are only packaged as `tar.gz` archive. Simply extract the archive in a folder of your choice with proper permissions.

== License

This information applies to the Subscription editions. No license is needed for the Community edition.

When you install or launch Bonita Studio for the first time, you need to install a license:

. From the installer, click *_Copy to clipboard_* to copy the request key generated specifically for your Bonita Studio
. Go to the https://customer.bonitasoft.com/license/request[Customer Service Center] and request a license using the request key in the clipboard
. Wait a few seconds to get the file from the license page, or check your email box (after a few minutes) and open the email from `no-reply@bonitasoft.com`
. Download the license file (.lic)
. Go back to your Bonita Studio, click *_Install license..._*, and select your .lic file.

== Embedded Java

Since 2024.1, all Bonita Studio packages come with an embedded Java runtime. It uses https://eclipse.dev/justj[Eclipse JustJ, target="blank"] behind the hood.

WARNING: This Java runtime is only used inside a Bonita Studio. When trying to build and run a Bonita project outside the Studio, make sure to have a xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[compliant Java Runtime version, target="blank"].

== First Bonita Studio execution

To start Bonita Studio, go to the directory where you installed it, and run the launcher for your operating system.

=== Community edition
* Windows: `BonitaStudioCommunity.exe`
* macOS: `BonitaStudioCommunity.app`
* Linux: `BonitaStudioCommunity`

=== Subscription edition
* Windows: `BonitaStudioSubscription.exe`
* macOS: `BonitaStudioSubscription.app`
* Linux: `BonitaStudioSubscription`

Now Bonita Studio should be running on your computer. +
If not, you can manually start it by using the installed shortcut or by using the Bonita Studio executable file from the installation folder.

== Installation validation

To make sure that everything is properly installed, you may create a new project from the Welcome Page or the _File_ menu. Once the project initialized, click on the *Applications* button in the toolbar. This should open the Bonita Application Directory in your web browser:
