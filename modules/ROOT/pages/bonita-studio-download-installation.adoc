== Bonita Studio download

=== Prerequisites

Check the xref:ROOT:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements].

==== MacOs specific prerequisites

[IMPORTANT]
====
For users of macOS Big Sur 11.0 and above: Only version 7.11.4 and upwards are compatible
====

Only *installed JDK* are accepted by the macOS _gatekeeper_. +
If you try to use a JDK directly downloaded, you will get this kind of error: _jdk-11.0.5 can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer._ +
The solution is to use an installer to install properly the JDK. The easiest way is to tape the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Install brew first if it is not installed yet, more details here: https://brew.sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Use brew to install a JDK
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew cask install java11
----

Another solution is to download and execute manually the installer, https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html[here for example].

==== Windows specific note

The security feature called *SmartScreen* prevents execution of Bonita Studio installer.  When you get the "Windows protect your PC" pop up window, click on "More info" link and click on "Run anyway" button.
