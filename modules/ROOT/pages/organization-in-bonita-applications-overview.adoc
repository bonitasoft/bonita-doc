In practice, this includes:

* the parent groups
* child groups
* the number and list of users in a group
* the roles and the number of users with that role
* personal and professional data about the user
* Custom User Information on users
* the date and time of the user's last login

The Administrator has the rights to:

* xref:import-export-an-organization.adoc[install an organization exported from Bonita Studio]
* xref:import-export-an-organization.adoc[export an organization from the Bonita Install / Export Organization page]
* create, update, and delete groups, from the xref:admin-application-groups-list.adoc[Administrator application]
* create, update, and delete roles, from the xref:admin-application-roles-list.adoc[Administrator application]
* create, update, and manage users and manage memberships, from the link:admin-application-users-list.adoc[Administrator application]

When you first launch the Bonita Administrator Application in a Production environment, there is *no default organization*.
You must xref:first-steps-after-setup.adoc[create a user and map it to the Administrator profile]. This user can than create and manage the organization.
