== Overview of the generic web service connector

The Bonita Studio includes a generic web service connector that leverages SOAP 1.2 protocol.

=== Generic configuration

. Go to Web services in the connectors list.
. Select**Web Service Client.**
. Click on *_Next_*
. Enter a name and description for the connector.
. Click on _*Next.*_

To format your entries according to SOAP specifications, go to http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#intro[SOAP!]

See a working example of a web service connector in this xref:web-service-tutorial.adoc[tutorial].

WARNING: this connector uses the StAX API. StAX libraries cannot be loaded in more than one classloader but must instead be placed in a single location where they can be called by all the items that use them. +
When you configure a process that uses this connector, you must xref:manage-jar-files.adoc[manage the jar files].

== Tutorial

Learn how to use a Web Service connector to call a publicly available Web Service, store the answer and display the information.

The web service used in this example provides the capital of a given country.

. In the BDM, create a business object _*Country*_ with the following attributes:

|===
| Name | Type

| id
| STRING

| capital
| STRING
|===

. Create the diagram (as shown in the example bellow)

image::images/connector_webservice_tuto/webservice_diagram.png[web service process diagram]

. Select the Pool > Data, click on the _*Pool Variables tab*_, add a process variable _country_ (Text) and a Business variable _countryBo_ (Country)
. Select the Pool > Execution, click on the _*Contract tab*_, and add a variable _countryInput_ (Text) on the contract.
. Add an instantiation form: select the Pool > Execution, click on the _*Instantiation form tab*_, and click on the pencil on the right of the field _Target form_, it should open the UI designer. The idea here is to create a combo box which will propose some countries. The selected country will be passed to the contract.

* Rename  the form into _countrySelection_
* Add a JSON data _countries_, with the following content:
+
[source,json]
----
[{ "name": "France","code": "FRA"},{"name": "Switzerland","code": "CH"},{"name": "Finland","code": "FI"}]
----

* Add a select widget, with the following parameters:
 ** *Availables values:* countries
 ** *Displayed key:* name
 ** *Returned key:* code
 ** *Value:* formInput.countryInput
* Ensure in the preview that the combo box gives the possibility to select one of the countries, and we are done for the instantiation form.

. Go back on the _country_ process variable, and set the _countryInput_ as default value.
. Select the  _*No*_ flow,  go on the _*General tab*_ and set this flow as the Default flow.
. Select the  _*Yes*_ flow, go on the _*General tab*_. Check _Use expression_, and add the following script as the expression to use:

[source,groovy]
----
!countryDAO.findById(country, 0, 100).isEmpty()
----

. Select the _*Retrieve already known capital task*_, go on the _*Execution tab*_ and click on _*Operations*_. Add the following operation:

* *Left operand*: countryBo
* *Operation*: takeValueOf
* *Right operand*: A script _retrieveCountry_, with the following content:

[source,groovy]
----
countryDAO.findById(country, 0, 100).get(0)
----

. Select the _*retrieveUnknownCapital*_ task, go on the _*Execution tab*_ and click on _*Connectors in*_.
. Add a _*WebService SOAP 1.2*_ connector to this task and configure it using the wizard.
. Enter the WDSL URL http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL, and click on the Introspect button, then leave the login info fields empty
. In the *Request parameters* window (for all editions), provide these settings:

* Port name: CountryInfoServiceSoap12
* End point address: http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso
* Binding: http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/
* Envelope

[source,xml]
----
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <soap12:Envelope xmlns:soap12="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
      <soap12:Body>
        <CapitalCity xmlns="http://www.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo">
          <sCountryISOCode>${country}</sCountryISOCode>
        </CapitalCity>
      </soap12:Body>
    </soap12:Envelope>
----

. In the *Response configuration* window, check the *Returns body* checkbox to use the response body in the output operations.
. In the *Output operations* window, keep only one output operation:

* *Left operand*: countryBo
* *Operation*: Java method \-> setCapital
* *Right operand*: A script _parseCapital_  returning a String, with the following content
+
[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.xml.XmlUtil

def reponseBody = new XmlSlurper().parseText(XmlUtil.serialize(responseDocumentBody.getDocumentElement()))
reponseBody.text()
----

TIP: To manipulate more complex XML documents, have a look to the https://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html[Groovy XML processing documentation page].

And we are done for the connector configuration. If you want to test it from the wizard, replace _$\{country}_ by _FRA_ in the envelope, and ensure that _Paris_ is returned.

. Select the _*Retrieve unknown capital*_ task, go on the _*Execution tab*_, click on _*Operations*_ and add the following operation:
 ** *Left operand*: countryBo
 ** *Operation*: Use a java method \-> setId
 ** *Right operand*: country
. Select the _*Display capital*_ task, go on the _*Execution tab*_, click on _*Form*_ and click on the pencil to create the form of this task. The UI Designer should open. The idea here is to simply display the field _capital_ of the business object used in the case (which has been created during the case or retrieved from the database). This business object is accessible in the context.

* Create a _*Javascript expression*_ variable named _*api*_, with the following content:
+
[source,Javascript]
----
return "../" + $data.context.countryBo_ref.link;
----

* Create an _*External API*_ variable named _*country*_, with the following api url:

----
{{api}}
----

* Insert a text widget in the form, with the following text property:

----
Capital: {{country.capital}}
----

Rename the form into _*Display capital*_, save it, and we are done.

. We do not want to implement a case overview for this simple use case. Select the pool, go on the _*Execution tab*_, click on _*Overview page*_ and select _*No form*_.
. Test the process, by following those steps:

* Select the pool
* Configure the actor mapping to the group "/acme"
* Click on the "Run" button to install and enable the process and be redirected to the instantiation form
* From the instantiation form in your browser, select a country and submit
* The browser will be redirected to the user perspective in the Portal
* A new task "Display Capital" should be available (refresh if not), click on it
* The capital should appear on its associated form
