Discover what Bonita Studio is, as well as its main features.

== What Bonita Studio is

Bonita Studio is the central tool to design processes and applications. This is the place to:

* xref:diagram-overview.adoc[Draw processes]
* xref:define-and-deploy-the-bdm.adoc[Define the Business Data Model], business variables, and xref:contracts-and-contexts.adoc[contracts]  
* Define the xref:organization-overview.adoc[organization] and xref:actors.adoc[actors]
* Manage the project extensions
* Create the application descriptors
* Launch the UI Designer to create process forms and application pages and layouts
* Plug the connectors
* Test the process execution, thanks to the embedded Tomcat and provided Bonita User Interfaces
* Configure the processes according to target environments
* Build the processes for deployment

== Download and install

The full download and installation procedure is explained in xref:bonita-studio-download-installation.adoc[Studio installation].

=== Log files

In case of trouble when running Bonita Studio, you might want to take a look at log files.

Studio log file can be displayed from Bonita Studio in "Help" \-> "Show Bonita Studio log" menu.

If Studio fails to start, you can open the log file manually. File is named `.log` and is located in `<studio_folder>/workspace/.metadata` folder. +
Note that folder might be hidden and file might not be displayed if you choose to hide file extensions in your file manager.

=== JVM terminated. Exit code=1

If when launching the Studio you get an error message "JVM terminated. Exit code=1" it might be because you try to launch Bonita Studio with a version of the JVM that is not supported. See above "Configure Bonita Studio to use a specific JVM" how to force the JVM to use.

=== OutOfMemory error in Bonita Studio

After installation, you might see an `OutOfMemory` error in Bonita Studio.
This error sometimes occurs when importing a large process definition. +
The log messages are similar to the following:

[source,log]
----
!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.467
!ERROR Import has failed for file Autorisation Engagement Depenses-2.0.bos

!ENTRY org.bonitasoft.studio.importer 4 0 2014-04-25 09:43:49.470
!ERROR
!STACK 0
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
----

To fix this issue, you need to increase the memory allocated to the JVM that runs Bonita Studio.

Edit the `*.ini` file that corresponds to the executable you use to launch the Studio and modify this line: `-Xmx512m` to `-Xmx1024m` (or higher).

Then restart Bonita Studio.

=== OutOfMemory error in Bonita Studio embedded Tomcat server

When using connectors having a large amount of dependencies you may encounter some memory issue with the default `-Xmx` used for the tomcat server. +
You can increase this value in Studio preferences \-> Server settings \-> Tomcat Maximum memory allocation.

==== Bonita Studio installation fail due to JVM errors

A given Bonita Studio version can only run with some specifics Java versions (xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements]). +
If you encounter some issues related to the JVM during the installation, ensure first that a valid Java version is available. You can for exemple type _java -version_ on a terminal, and informations about the main Java version used will be displayed. +
If the problem persist, the easiest way to solve it is to remove the installed Java versions, to download that last stable build of the required Java version https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[on the Oracle website] and to install it properly. +
Those issues can be related to bad Java installations, or to incompatibilities between a given Java version and Bitrock (Bitrock is the install builder used to install Bonita, it has the responsibility to detect the JRE used to install Bonita. Some defects on a given version could lead to incompatibility).
