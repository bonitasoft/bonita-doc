Notes:

. Bonita can be executed on Java 8 or 11. All development artifacts (connectors, REST API extensions, etc) must be compiled with Java 8 byte code (target version). Bonita 2021.1 (7.12) is the latest version fully compatible with java 8 in production and development environment. JRE or JDK 11+ will be required to run. Bonita 2021.2+ won't be operated on Java 8.
. Memory usage: In a Studio, by default, the embedded Tomcat server is started with a maximum memory allocation set to 521Mo. Depending on your usage you may need to xref:bonita-bpm-studio-installation.adoc[increase this value].
. Your database must be configured to use the UTF-8 character set.
. MySQL must be configured to use UTF-8, we recommand using `utf8mb4` because `utf8mb3` is deprecated, see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb3.html[MySQL documentation].
MySQL must be configured with innoDB storage engine.
. Oracle must be configured using AL32UTF8 character set to store properly all _Char_ data
