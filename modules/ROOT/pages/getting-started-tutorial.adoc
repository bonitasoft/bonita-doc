This tutorial explains how to create an application that includes a process. The application is created using the Bonita BPM Community Edition, and uses features that are available in all editions. The example application is a business travel tool.

IMPORTANT: these instructions are also available as a http://www.bonitasoft.com/resources/videos/getting-started-tutorial[video]. The complete solution is available on https://github.com/Bonitasoft-Community/getting-started-turorial[GitHub].

Here is the use-case: _An employee opens the Travel Tool application to view their pending and approved travel requests. They create a new travel request. Then the request is sent to the employee's manager.
The manager reviews the request and approves or refuses it._

In a real travel management application, there would be several process steps after approval: estimating costs, possibly getting a second level of approval if the cost passes a certain threshold, submitting an expenses claim after the travel, reviewing the expenses claim, escalating anything out of policy, and authorizing payment. However, for this tutorial you will consider only the first part of the process, where a travel request is submitted and then reviewed.

This tutorial assumes that you are a developer using Bonita BPM for the first time. +
It gives instructions for using Bonita BPM Studio, the UI Designer, and Bonita BPM Portal. It assumes you are familiar with JavaScript, JSON and REST APIs.

Use Bonita BPM Studio to define your process, including using the UI Designer to create pages and forms. Then use Bonita BPM Portal to build the application.

This is the recommended sequence for creating an application, but generally application pages, data model and processes are defined in parallel and evolve as you go deeper in the application details:

== Design application pages

The first step in creating an application is to design the application pages in the UI Designer using dummy data, creating a prototype application as seen by users. This enables you to review the application with the stakeholders and get validation of the application design before proceeding to more complex tasks.

The Bonita BPM Studio UI Designer is an environment for creating application pages and forms. To start the UI Designer, click the UI Designer icon in the Bonita BPM Studio coolbar (at the top of the screen). The UI Designer opens in a browser.

The travel tool has a home page that displays a list of pending and approved travel requests to the current user. It contains a button for starting a new travel request.

There are also some forms that are associated with the travel management process:

* Create a travel request
* Review a travel request and approve or refuse it

The easiest way to create these forms is from the process definition, so that is what you will do later in the tutorial.

The following sections explain how to create the application page and then populate it with dummy data. At any stage, you can click *_Preview_* and see a preview of the layout of the page as it will appear to users. +
Remember to click *_Save_* to save your work frequently.

[discrete]
==== Create travel tool home page

In Bonita BPM Studio, start the UI Designer by clicking the icon in the coolbar. This opens the UI Designer in your browser, at the home page.

* In the UI Designer home page, click on the *_Create_* button. This brings a pop-up.
* In the pop-up, set the type to _Application page_ and name to _TravelTool_. The name must not contain spaces or special characters. This name is used in Bonita BPM to identify the page. It is not displayed to the application user.
* Click on *_Create_*. This opens the new page in the Page editor.

Create the page structure by dragging widgets from the palette on the left and dropping them on the whiteboard (the central panel). +
Specify the characteristics of a widget by selecting it and updating the properties in the panel on the right. Add the following widgets:

* A TEXT widget, with the *Text* property set to _username_.
* A TITLE widget, with the *Text* property set to _Travel tool_.
* A TEXT widget, with text introducing the application: `This page lists your pending and approved travel requests.`
* A CONTAINER for the user pending requests, with the following widgets:
 ** A TITLE widget with a lower title level than the page title (for example, "Level 3"), with the text `My pending requests`.
 ** A TABLE widget for listing pending travel requests, with the following properties:
  *** *Headers* set to `Departure date, Number of nights, Hotel needed, Destination, Reason`
  *** *Columns key* set to `departureDate, numberOfNights, hotelNeeded, destination, reason`
 ** A LINK widget with text `Create new travel request` and *Style* property set to primary.
* A CONTAINER for the user approved requests, with the following widgets:
 ** A TITLE widget with a lower title level than the page title (for example, "Level 3"), with the text `My approved requests`.
 ** A TABLE widget for listing approved travel requests, with the following properties:
  *** *Headers* set to `Departure date, Number of nights, Hotel needed, Destination, Reason`.
  *** *Columns key* set to `departureDate, numberOfNights, hotelNeeded, destination, reason`.

When you have added the widgets, click *_Preview_* to see how the page displays. +
Change the arrangement of the widgets in the whiteboard using drag and drop and using the *Width* property, until you are happy with the result.

Remember to click the topmost *_Save_* button, or type `Ctrl+S` to save your work.

==== Add dummy data

Now use some dummy data to see how the tables will look when there is data. +
First create a variable containing the data, and then bind the variable to the widget *Value* property. +
In the application, the real data will be business data retrieved by a REST API call. +
The dummy data for the travel requests is in JSON. You need two JSON variables, `myPendingRequests` and `myApprovedRequests`.

To create *myPendingRequests*:

. In the *Variables* panel (at the bottom of the page), click *_Create a new variable_*.
. Enter the variable name, *myPendingRequests*.
. Select the JSON type.
. Enter this value:

[source,json]
----
  [
      {
          "userId": 3,
          "destination": "Grenoble",
          "departureDate": "2016-02-09",
          "numberOfNights": 1,
          "hotelNeeded": true,
          "reason": "Bonita BPM 7.2 launch",
          "status": "pending",
          "refusalReason": ""
      },
      {
          "userId": 3,
          "departureDate": "2016-10-09",
          "numberOfNights": 3,
          "hotelNeeded": false,
          "destination": "Paris",
          "reason": "Open source conference",
          "status": "pending",
          "refusalReason": ""
      },
      {
          "userId": 3,
          "departureDate": "2016-07-07",
          "numberOfNights": 4,
          "hotelNeeded": false,
          "destination": "San Francisco",
          "reason": "BPAD training",
          "status": "pending",
          "refusalReason": ""
      }
  ]
----

. Click *_Save_*.
. Select the table widget for the pending requests.
. In the *Content* property, click the link icon at the right ("*fx*"), then click in the box and choose `myPendingRequests` from the list of variables (start typing the variable name to get auto-completion).
. Click *_Preview_* to see the page with data for pending requests. +
  Now follow the same steps to create `myApprovedRequests` with the following content:
+
[source,json]
----
  [
   {
       "userId": 3,
       "destination": "Tokyo",
       "departureDate": "2016-10-10",
       "numberOfNights": 5,
       "hotelNeeded": true,
       "reason": "BPM for HR conference",
       "status": "approved",
       "refusalReason": ""
   },
   {
       "userId": 3,
       "departureDate": "2015-12-11",
       "numberOfNights": 3,
       "hotelNeeded": false,
       "destination": "San Francisco",
       "reason": "Meetings with team",
       "status": "approved",
       "refusalReason": ""
   }
  ]
----

When you have defined this variable, select the table widget for the approved requests and set the value of the *Content* property to `myApprovedRequests` (remember to click on the "*fx*" icon).

[discrete]
==== Review and improve the page

You now have a prototype of the _TravelTool_ page with dummy data. View the prototype, and adjust the arrangement of the widgets until you are happy with the appearance of the page. +
You can drag and drop widgets to reorder them, and you can change properties including *Width* and *Alignment*. For example, to improve this page, you could make the following changes:

* Select the username widget, and change the *Alignment* to `right`.
* Select the "Travel Tool" title and drag it beside the username. The size of the username widget will automatically adjust, so that both widgets are in the same row.
* Select the "Create new travel request" link widget and change the *Alignment* to `center`.

== Create the data model

There are two stages to defining variables: first you define the business data model, and then you specify how the process handles objects of the model. +
The model is defined as a set of Java classes, and the process uses instances of these classes. If you are not familiar with the terminology, all you need to remember is that the model is the global definition, with a collection of structured variables. +
For your process, you select the subset that is relevant.

First, we will create the business data model, which will then be available for all processes. We will use a model with one object:

* _TravelRequest_ contains the details of the travel that is being requested and its approval status.

To define the business data model:

. Go to the *Development* menu, choose *Business Data Model*, and then choose *Manage...*. This opens the dialog to manage the business data model.
. Beside the list of business object types, click *_Add_*. A temporary type name, such as _BusinessObject1_ is added to the list.
. Click on the temporary name, and change it to _TravelRequest_.
. Select the _TravelRequest_ business object type, and add its attributes. This table shows the attributes and their types:
+
|===
| Variable | Data type | Mandatory

| userId
| Long
| yes

| departureDate
| Date Only
| yes

| numberOfNights
| Integer
| yes

| hotelNeeded
| Boolean
| yes

| destination
| String
| yes

| reason
| String
| yes

| status
| String
| yes

| refusalReason
| String
| no
|===

To add each attribute:

. In the *Attributes* tab, click *_Add_*. A temporary attribute name ("attribute1") is added to the Name column.
. Change the temporary name to the attribute name.
. Select the type from the drop-down list. To display the list, click at the right end of the *Type* column.
. There are no *Multiple* attributes in this object, so you can ignore this column.
. In the *Mandatory* column, check the box for the attributes that are mandatory.
. Add a custom query that you will use to search for data using both the userId and the status:
 .. In the *Queries* tab, select *Custom*.
 .. Click *_Add_*. A temporary query name ("query1") is added to the *Name* column.
 .. Change the temporary name to `findByUserIdAndStatus`.
 .. Click in the query column, and then click the edit icon at the right. This opens a popup with a proposed custom query that uses all the attributes.
 .. In the *JPQL Query* field, remove these lines:

+
----
AND t.departureDate = :departureDate
AND t.numberOfNights = :numberOfNights
AND t.hotelNeeded = :hotelNeeded
AND t.destination = :destination
AND t.reason = :reason
AND t.refusalReason = :refusalReason
----
 .. In the Parameters list, delete all the attributes except _userId_ and _status_.
 .. Click *_OK_* to save the query.
. Click *_Finish_* to save the business data model.

== Create the process definition

==== Create the diagram

The first stage is to create the new diagram, which you do using Bonita BPM Studio. While you are working on a diagram, save your work from time to time, by clicking the *_Save_* icon in the coolbar (at the top of the screen) or typing `CTRL+S`. +
Create the diagram as follows:

. Click *_New diagram_* on the Bonita BPM Studio Welcome page. This creates an almost empty diagram for you to start updating:
 ** The large rectangle with a name at the left is the *pool*.
 ** Inside the pool there is a *lane*, which is also a rectangle. You can see the border of the lane at the left side, beside the pool name. The other borders of the lane coincide with the pool border so are not visible.
 ** The green circle in the lane is a *start event*.
 ** The blue box in the lane is a *human task*.
. The first thing to do is to give the diagram a more descriptive name. Click on the diagram outside the pool, then go to the *Details* panel. This is the area on the bottom-right of the screen.
. In the *General* tab, *Diagram* pane, click *_Edit..._* next to the *Name* field.
. Enter the new diagram name, _Simple Travel Request_, in the popup and click *_OK_*. You can see in the tab at the top of the whiteboard that the diagram name has changed.
. Now give the Pool a more descriptive name. Select the pool by clicking in the space between the pool border and the lane border at the left side of the diagram.
Then go to the *Details* panel, *General* tab, *Pool* pane, and click *_Edit..._* next to the *Name* field. Enter the new pool name, _Travel Request_, in the popup. +
When you have renamed the diagram and the pool, the diagram looks like this:

image::images/images-6_0/7.0-getting-started-renamed-diagram.png[Diagram with names changed]

. This process starts when an employee fills in a travel request form. You do not need to create a task for this because it is this action that triggers the process to start. This is known as process instantiation. A *form for process instantiation* is defined at the pool level.
. Define what happens after the user submits a request form: the manager reviews the travel request and approves or refuses it. You can use the example task that was added to the diagram automatically. Click on the task name and change it to _Manager review_.
. In a future evolution of this process, the next task would be to send the travel request details to the admin team so they can handle the booking. For now, though we are just interested in getting the first part of the process working, so add an end after the review task. You can do this by dragging the end icon (red circle) from the palette to the whiteboard, and then connecting to the _Manager review_ task with a flow element.

When you have finished, your diagram should look like this:

image::images/images-6_0/7.0-getting-started-completed-diagram.png[Completed diagram]

==== Define business variables

You have already defined the data model, but now you need to specify how the model is applied to this process. +
Define a _travelRequest_ business variable, which is an instance of the _TravelRequest_ object type. Follow these steps:

. Select the pool.
. Go to the *Details* panel, *Data* tab, *Pool variables* pane and click *_Add..._* beside the Business variables box.
. In the Name field, type _travelRequest_.
. Add a description to document your development if you want to.
. From the Business Object list, choose _TravelRequest_.
. Do not configure the default value. The default value uses information that is in the contract, so you will define it later.
. Click *_Finish_* to save the definition.

The attributes of _travelRequest_ are the information that is used in the process. There are no other variables to define.

[discrete]
==== Create contracts

A contract is the specification of what a form must return to the process instance. Define a contract for process instantiation, and for each human task.

The contract does not need to include information that is sent from the process instance to the form. This is included in the context, which is the set of information passed to the form. You cannot configure the context.

The information that you specify in the contract is a subset of the information used in the process. +
To specify the process instantiation contract, select the pool and follow these steps:

. Go to the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Contract* pane.
. In the *Inputs* tab, click *_Add from data..._*. This opens a popup for creating the contract using the business data variables that are defined for the process.
. Select _travelRequest_ and click *_Next_*.
. Specify the attributes to include. By default, all the attributes are checked, so uncheck those that are not relevant: _userId_, _status_ and _refusalReason_.
. Leave the radio button on automatic generation of initialization script.
. Click *_Finish_* and safely ignore the warning related to contract generation as we will take care of those in time.

Now that the case instantiation contract is set up, we will add two constraints on its values. +
The first one will ensure that the departure date is in the future and the second will validate that the number of nights is greater or equal to zero.

. Still in the *Contract* pane, switch to the *Constraints* tab and click *_Add_*. This adds a placeholder constraint.
. Click on the placeholder name and change it to _departureInFuture_.
. Click in the *Expression* field, then click on the icon that appears at the right of the field. This opens a popup where you can enter the constraint expression.
. Define the constraint with this script:``travelRequestInput.departureDate.isAfter(java.time.LocalDate.now())``
. In the *Error message* column, add this text: `Departure date must be in the future.`
. Add a second constraint as following:
 ** Name: `zeroOrMoreNights`
 ** Expression: `travelRequestInput.numberOfNights >= 0`
 ** Error message: `Number of nights must be greater or equal to zero.`

In the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Contract* pane, *Inputs* tab click the arrow next to *travelRequestInput* to expand the list of attributes. +
For each attribute, add a *Description*. The description is displayed in the automatically generated form used for process testing, so include information that will help the user complete the form correctly, as follows:

|===
| Attribute | Description

| departureDate
| Specify the date that the travel starts

| numberOfNights
| Enter the number of nights

| hotelNeeded
| Specify if you need a hotel reservation

| destination
| Enter the destination city

| reason
| Explain the reason for this travel. Give the business justification
|===

The process instantiation contract is now complete.

The contract for the _Manager review_ task only has two inputs, _status_ and _refusalReason_, so you can create it directly instead of from data. +
It also has a constraint: a _refusalReason_ must be specified if the manager refuses the request. To define this contract:

. Select the _Manager review_ task.
. Go to the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Contract* pane.
. In the *Inputs* tab, click *_Add_* and specify the following attributes:
+
|===
| Name | Type | Multiple | Description

| status
| Text
| No
| Indicate whether you approve or refuse this request

| refusalReason
| Text
| No
| If you refuse a request, you must give a reason
|===

. Go to the *Constraints* tab and click *_Add_*. This adds a placeholder constraint.
. Click on the placeholder name and change it to _reasonRequired_.
. Click in the *Expression* field, then click on the icon that appears at the right of the field. This opens a popup where you can enter the constraint expression.
. Define the constraint with this script:
`status == "approved" || (status == "refused" && refusalReason?.trim())`
. In the *Error message* column, add this text: `If you refuse a request, you must give a reason.`

[discrete]
==== Define business object initial values

Now that the contract is defined, you can configure the initial value of _travelRequest_, as follows:

. Select the pool and go to the *Details* panel, *Data* tab, *Pool variables* pane.
. Double-click _travelRequest_ to edit it.
. Click the pencil icon beside the *Default value* field. This opens the expression editor.
. An _initTravelRequest()_ script was automatically generated to initialize our data with the contract. We will complete this script by setting up the _userId_ and _status_ attributes. +
Insert the following code after the first line:
+
[source,groovy]
----
travelRequestVar.userId = BonitaUsers.getProcessInstanceInitiator(apiAccessor, processInstanceId).id
travelRequestVar.status = "pending"
----

. Click *_OK_* to save the expression.
. Click *_OK_* again to save the updated object definition.

[discrete]
==== Update business object with review data

You need to define operations to update the business object with the values entered for _status_ and _refusalReason_ in the _Manager review_ form. +
Select the _Manager review_ task, and go to the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Operations* pane. First define the operation for _status_, as follows:

. Create a new operation by clicking *_Add_*.
. In the first field, click the down-arrow to display a list of variables on which an operation can be performed, and double-click _travelRequest_.
. Click the *_Takes value of_* link. This opens a popup listing the available operations. Choose *_Use a Java method_*. The popup displays a list of available methods. Click *_setStatus(String) - void_*, and then click *_OK_*.
. In the last field, click the down-arrow to display a list of variables, and double-click _status_.

Repeat these steps to define the operation for _refusalReason_.

When both of the operations are defined, the *Details* panel should look like this:

image::images/images-6_0/7.0-getting-started-operations.png[Manager review operations]

[discrete]
==== Specify actors

The next stage is to define who carries out the steps in the process. This is done by assigning xref:actors.adoc[actors]. +
An actor is a placeholder for the person who will do a task. +
When you configure a process, you make the connection between the actors defined in the process definition and the real-world people who will do process steps. +
Bonita BPM Studio comes with a test organization, called ACME, which you can use for testing. In this example, we have two people, the employee who initiates the process, and the employee's manager. +
The managers are also employees, so you can use the same actor for process instantiation and for the review task, but use a filter to specify who does the approval step. This is how it works:

. In the diagram, select the pool and go to the *Details* panel, *General* tab, *Actors* pane. This is where you define all the actors for the process. +
By default, there is already an Employee actor, which is defined for testing. You can change the organization and the actors later, but for initial testing, this will work fine. +
The default settings mean that any employee in the organization can start a case of the travel request process. You do not need to change anything.
. Next, select the _Manager review_ step and define who can do this. This step will be done by the manager of the person who initiated the request. +
All the managers are also employees, and the employee actor is defined for the lane, so check the button for *Use the actor defined in the lane*.
. To make sure that the review task is sent to the right manager, use an actor filter:
 .. Click the actor filter *_Set..._* button.
 .. Open up the list of process actor filters.
 .. Select *Initiator manager*. This means that the review task is to be done by the manager of the person who submitted the request that initiated the process. Click *_Next_*
 .. Specify a name for the actor filter definition, _requestersManager_, and click *_Finish_*.

The process is now defined. The next section shows you how to configure and run it to verify that the process definition is correct before you define forms and create the application.

[discrete]
==== Run process with temporary forms

You can run a process that is in development before you create forms, by using temporary forms that are created automatically. +
This section explains how to configure the process and run it from Bonita BPM Studio.

Before you can run the process, you need to configure it. For the first run we will use the default setting.

You can run the process and see the temporary forms, to check that the process definition is correct.

. Click *_Run_* in the coolbar. This opens a browser window, logs you in to Bonita BPM Portal as Walter Bates (user used for authentication in the default process configuration), and displays the travel request form.
. Fill out the form. Make sure that you use the right format for each field in the temporary forms ("yyyy-mm-dd" format for dates and either "true" or "false" value for booleans).
. When you have filled out the form, click *_Start_*. This submits the form and starts the process instance.
. At the top-right of the Portal window, click the arrow beside Walter's name and choose *_Logout_*.
. Log in as Walter's manager, Helen Kelly, with username `helen.kelly` and password `bpm`. The *Tasks* view is displayed, where there is a task called _Manager review_.
. Select the _Manager review_ task. The temporary form for the manager review is displayed in the right hand panel. +
It contains fields for the items defined in the contract for this step, but not the information that Walter entered in the request. +
When you create your own forms, you will add this information, so that the manager can see the details of the request before approving or refusing it. +
For now, you can see the form, so you have verified that the process definition is correct.

== Create forms

The easiest way to create a process form is to generate it automatically from the contract. This automatically creates a mapping between the process and the form and defines form data. You can then update the form manually to add or remove field, and to change the layout.

While using the UI Designer, click *_Save_* frequently to save your work.

To create the process instantiation form:

. In Bonita BPM Studio, select the pool and go to the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Contract* pane.
. At the top-right of the *Details* panel, click the UI Designer icon. This opens the UI Designer in a browser window, with the automatically generated form.
. Change the form name. All forms that are generated automatically are called _newForm_, so you must rename them to avoid confusion. +
To do this, double-click on the name in the top bar, and then specify a new form name, _submitTravelRequest_.

The form is now created. A form is a UI Designer page that is mapped to a process and a contract. A page is a collection of widgets, and each field is defined by a widget. +
Widgets are arranged in rows and each row is divided into 12 columns. Each widget has a width that spans across one or more column. In addition to their width, widgets have a set of editable properties that can be set on the right side of the window.

To change the appearance and behavior of a page, you update the widgets. At any time, you can click *_Preview_* to see how the page will look to a user. +
To have more space to update the page, you can hide the *Variables* and *Assets* tabs, by clicking on the down-arrow.

Before improving the look of the form, we will enforce some validation rules on the different fields:

. Select the _Number Of Nights_ widget and set its _Min value_ property to _0_.
. Preview the form and try to enter some values to make sure that the validation works. Submit button should be disabled until all widgets contain valid values.

The form should now look like this in the page editor:

image::images/images-6_0/7.2-getting-started-inst-form-validation.png[Process instantiation form]

Now that the form is functional, we are going to improve its appearance to make it more user-friendly:

. Select the title widget, and change the *Text* property to `Submit a new travel request`.
. Make the Departure date widget narrower. To do this, select it and change the value of the *Width* property to 4 columns.
. Move the Destination widget up to the top of the form (below the title).
. Move the Number of nights and Hotel needed widgets to the same row as the Departure date, and reduce the widths. +
Note: when you add a widget to a row, it automatically takes all the remaining columns, so set the width after you move the widgets.
. Clear the initial value for Number of nights to show the placeholder at run time:
 .. In the *Variables* panel (at the bottom of the page), locate the row containing the _formInput_ variable.
 .. Click on the pencil icon located at the right side of this row.
 .. Change the value of the _numberOfNights_ attribute from _0_ to _null_.
 .. Click on *Save*.

When you have finished, the preview of the form looks like this:

image::images/images-6_0/7.2-getting-started-inst-form-rendering.png[Process instantiation form]

Now define the form for the _Manager review_ task. Start by automatically generating the form from the context, then add widgets to display the request details for the manager to review. Follow these steps:

. In Bonita BPM Studio, select the _Manager review_ task and go to the *Details* panel, *Execution* tab, *Contract* pane.
. At the top-right of the *Details* panel, click the UI Designer icon. This generates a form and opens it in the UI Designer.
. Change the form name to _reviewTravelRequest_.
. Add a variable to get the information that the user enters in the request form. To do this:
 .. In the *Variables* tab, click *_Create a new variable_*.
 .. Specify the name, _request_.
 .. Set the *Type* to *External API*.
 .. Set the value to `../{{context.travelRequest_ref.link}}`.
 .. Click *_Save_*.
. Add a variable to hold the different request status values:
+
|===
| Name | Type | Value

| statusValues
| JSON
| `[{"label": "Approve request", "value": "approved"},{"label": "Refuse request", "value": "refused"}]`
|===

. Edit the _formInput_ variable and set the value for the _status_ attribute to _"approved"_.
. All of the other widgets you will add will be placed inside the form container (identified with a dashed border).
. Add a title widget and set its text property to `Review travel request`. Set the *Level* property to Level 4, so it is the same size as the title of the form for creating a request.
. Add read-only widgets to display the details of the travel request, using the following information:
+
|===
| Label | Widget type | Value binding | Read-only

| Destination
| Input
| request.destination
| yes

| Departure date
| Date picker
| request.departureDate
| yes

| Number of nights
| Input
| request.numberOfNights
| yes

| Hotel needed
| Checkbox
| request.hotelNeeded
| yes

| Reason for travel
| Text area
| request.reason
| yes
|===

. Remove the "Refusal reason" widget that was added automatically, we will replace it by something more user-friendly in the next step.
. Add a Text area widget with the following properties:
+
|===
| Property | Value

| Hidden
| `formInput.status === 'approved'` (click on "fx"/"bind" icon first)

| Label

== Run process

You can now run the process using the forms that you created. Make sure that you have saved everything in the UI Designer. Then click *_Run_* in the Studio coolbar.

Fill out the request form as Walter, then log in as Helen and do the review task. +
When the review form is displayed, it contains the information that Walter entered in the request form. You can approve or refuse the request.

Once process is finished you can see the request information as stored in the business data database in Bonita Studio:

. From the menu bar, choose *Development* menu, choose *Business Data Model*, and then choose *Brows data (h2 console)...*. This opens the h2 (business data database) web interface in a web browser.
. In the left tree menu click on TRAVELREQUEST. This will generate an SQL select query.
. Click on *Run (Ctrl+Enter)* button. You should view all the requests created by running the Travel Request process.

You process is now complete, so you can include it in an application.

== Build the application

This section explains how to build the application from the pages and process that you have already created. There are the following steps:

. In the UI Designer, update the application page to use business data instead of the dummy JSON data and to specify the connection between the page and the process.
. In Bonita BPM Portal, create the application.

==== Update the TravelTool application page

In the UI Designer edit the TravelTool page and create the following variables:

|===
| Name | Type | Value

| session
| External API
| `../API/system/session/unusedId`

| processDef
| External API
| `../API/bpm/process?p=0&c=1&f=name=Travel%20Request`
|===

Update (edit) the following variables:

|===
| Name | Type | Value

| myPendingRequests
| External API
| `../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.TravelRequest?q=findByUserIdAndStatus&p=0&c=10&f=userId={{session.user_id}}&f=status=pending`

| myApprovedRequests
| External API
| `../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.TravelRequest?q=findByUserIdAndStatus&p=0&c=10&f=userId={{session.user_id}}&f=status=approved`
|===

Now update the widgets to use the new variables:

. Select the username widget at the top of the page, and update the *Text* to this value: `{{session.user_name}}`.
. For both pending and approved requests, set the *Column keys* to `departureDate | date, numberOfNights, hotelNeeded, destination, reason`, to set the date format.

==== Link button to process

When the user clicks the button on the Travel Tool page for creating a travel request, the application displays the form for creating a request. +
This is the instantiation form for the Travel Request process. +
To configure this, select the button and set the target URL property by first clicking on the change to bind to an expression button ('`fx`' to the right of the field) and then updating the expression to  `"/bonita/portal/resource/process/Travel%20Request/1.0/content/?id="+processDef[0].id`.

After the user submits the form, the Tasks view of Bonita BPM Portal is displayed.

To build the Travel Tool application, you need to export the page from the UI Designer, deploy the process, and then create the application in Bonita BPM Portal.

To export the page, click the *_Export_* icon in the Page editor (next to the Save button) or on the home page. The page is exported as a zip file in your default browser download location.

To deploy the process, you can simply run it from Bonita BPM Studio. If you have no changed the process since you last ran it, it is already deployed.

To create your application in Bonita BPM Portal:

. Log in to Bonita BPM Portal by clicking the Portal icon in the coolbar and click the arrow beside "User" and select "Administrator" to switch to Administrator profile .
. From the menu bar, choose *Resources*, and then click *_Add_* and import the TravelTool page that you exported from the UI Designer.
. Go to *Applications* and click *_New_*.
. Name your application _Travel App_, set its URL to _travel_, and click *_Create_*. The application is created.
. In the list of applications, click the edit (triple dot) icon to configure your new application.
. In the *Pages* section, click *_Add_*.
. Select the Travel tool page you imported. Set its URL to _requests_. Click *_Add_*.
. Make this page the application home page by clicking on the home icon that appears when hovering on it.
. Delete the default home page.
. Check that the application is correctly defined, by clicking the URL. The travel requests summary page is displayed, with a link to the form to create a new request.
When you click the link, the form for submitting a new travel requests is displayed.
