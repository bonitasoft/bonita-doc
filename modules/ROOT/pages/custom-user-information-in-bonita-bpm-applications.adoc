== Overview

Custom User Information -CUI) account for additional information than the provided information defined in Bonita Studio to describe users. This may be needed to define the right actors for a human task.
Each CUI is defined in Bonita Studio organization, and used in the specific _Users with custom information_ provided actor filter in Bonita Studio. +
CUIs are also displayed in Bonita Portal, in the _More_ page of a user. +
This allows the Administrator to edit the values of a CUI for a given user, and by this means change the actor mapping. +
The Administrator cannot create a CUI nor edit a CUI definition.

[NOTE]
====

if no customer user definitions are set in Bonita Studio, then no information will be displayed in Bonita Portal. +
However, definitions can be created and edited using the xref:customuserinfo-api.adoc[Web REST API]. +
The Organization .xml file can also be exported from Bonita Portal, modified by hand externally, and then re-imported back into Bonita Portal, although we strongly advise to always modify resources from the development environment and then deploy iteratively on the test environments until the Production environment.
