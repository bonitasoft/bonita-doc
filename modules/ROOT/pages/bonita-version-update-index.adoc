== Updating Bonita Studio

You can automatically update Bonita Studio from an earlier version of Bonita, provided it is not earlier than 6.0.2. +
After the update, a process continues to run unchanged. You can modify the process definition later to take advantage of the new features in the new version of Bonita.
