= Bonita Portal - Mobile version

The Bonita Portal has a mobile version thought to be used by the User profile only. It displays the User task list and the process list.

== Security login

== Do I need a special license?

You will need an Efficiency license (and above) to run the mobile version

== What deployment bundle do I need to access the mobile version?

Bonita Subscription Pack edition

== How do I access it?

Add `/mobile` after Bonita in the URL

For example: http://localhost:8080/bonita/mobile

== Profile

Only the user profile is available.

== Mobile language

* How do I change the language of the mobile interface
* You need to change the language in the Bonita Portal first

== Navigation

The navigation is slightly different from the Portal (first choose a filter to list corresponding tasks, then click on a task in the list to display it).

NOTE: to display forms properly in the mobile version, only create a form with one column. If more than one column is used in a form design, then you will have to right scroll to display all the form.

== What menus and functions are available?

Display and perform tasks, create subtasks, add comments.

== Start a new case

You can now start a case from the mobile version. Click *_Apps_* to see a list of the processes for which you can start a case. Click on an App to start a case.
