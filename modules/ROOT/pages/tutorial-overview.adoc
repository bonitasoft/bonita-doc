== What are the steps to create a Bonita application?

Thanks to the low-code Bonita platform you won't need to write a lot of code to create an application.
The creation of Bonita applications relies heavily on models:

* a process model (using BPMN standard)
* a data model for business data management
* a WYSIWYG tool for user interface design
* and more.

Creating an application in Bonita Studio (the Bonita development environment) requires the following steps:

* graphically design one or several processes using BPMN notation
* define the data model using the Bonita Business Data Management feature (you can of course use your own database if needed)
* create web user interfaces using the Bonita UI Designer (or your preferred web framework)
* define users involved in the process, as well as the resources they have access to
* configure connectors to integrate Bonita with the information system (e.g. to send an email, call a web service, and more.)

We will cover these steps in this getting started tutorial so you can get familiar with the concepts behind a Bonita application.
