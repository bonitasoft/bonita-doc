The user task list page provides information such as: user's tasks, tasks to do, already done tasks related to different processes.

== Overview

Starting with Bonita 7.3, users benefit from a configurable task list, to manage tasks involving human actors from all processes in a more efficient fashion.
This page is also made available as a custom page in Bonita Portal > Resources, to be used in any xref:applications.adoc[application] or xref:custom-profiles.adoc[custom profiles], for users types of profiles.

Here are the values of the user task list:

* Default Master/Detail design pattern, to view list and form in the same screen
* _Panel expand_ feature, to display wide forms in a large modal window

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

* List settings: number of tasks in a page, choice of columns, columns ordering
* Easy access to case information, one tab away from the form. This case information is the case overview page, that the development team can customize
* Easy access to case comments, also one tab away from the form or case information

* Alternate "full width" list, with task information displayed in a large modal window

This list also leverages two legacy features (prior to Bonita 7.3.0):

* Dynamic task display name, for efficient task identification (insert case information in task name)
* Word-based search, for efficient task name search (search for any word in the task name)

To know more about how to use both features, go to xref:optimize-user-tasklist.adoc[How to create unique task names for user task list].

The task list also contains a *Done tasks* filter, for the user to check if the task has been completed properly.

[NOTE]
====

Since Bonita 7.3.0, creating subtasks is no longer possible. However, if subtasks have been created in a process instance in an old Bonita version, and if the Bonita Platform has been migrated to a later version while the case was open, then the subtasks will still be visible to the users assigned, and users will still be able to complete them.
