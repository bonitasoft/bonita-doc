= Process list in Bonita Administrator Application

This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile can see and do about processes in link:admin-application-overview[Bonita Administrator Application].

Those users can: install, enable and edit processes, categories, forms, entities mapped to actors and process manager, parameters, and connectors.

== Install a new process

This feature is only available for the _Administrator_ profile.

. Go to _BPM_ > _Processes_
. Click on the _Install_ button on the top right of the page
. Click to browse to the .bar file to import
. Click on _Install_

The .bar file is ready to be resolved and/or enabled.

You can only install a .bar file that was exported from a Bonita Studio of the same minor (7.x) version as your Bonita Portal and Bonita Engine. +
If you have a .bar file that was exported from an earlier version of Bonita Studio (7.x-1), it will not work with Bonita Engine. +
Export the process definition as a .bos file from your old Bonita Studio, import in into the new Studio, then export it as a .bar. +
This is necessary for a .bar that has not been deployed. A process that was developed in an older version of Bonita Studio and is already deployed is migrated automatically when you migrate your platform. +
However, for future maintenance of the process definition, you are recommended to update all your process .bar files to the latest version each time you update your platform.

== Resolve a process

Resolving a process means completing the configuration in the Administrator Application and making sure that all dependencies are met. A process has to be resolved before it can be enabled.
To resolve a process, you must complete the configuration of the actor mappings, parameters, forms, and connectors defined for the process.

* *Actors*: Every actor in a process must be mapped to at least one user, group, role or membership.
* *Parameters*: Every parameter defined in a process must have a value.
* *Connectors*: Every connector definition in a process must have a corresponding implemenetation (Class name).
* *Forms*: Every form defined in a process must be mapped to a page or a URL.
* Also, every business variable used in the process should have a corresponding model.

To resolve a process for actors, parameters, connectors, and forms:

. Go to _BPM_>__Processes__
. On the row of the process, click on _View process details_ icon.
. A summary of configuration problems is displayed below the process name in a well and warning icons are displayed in the left navigation list.
. Modify your configuration for each element displayed.

To resolve a process for business variables:

. Logout
. Login in Bonita Administrator Portal with the xref:tenant_admin_credentials.adoc[technical user credentials]
