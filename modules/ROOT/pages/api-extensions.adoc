Extend REST Resources using Bonita, to send information on a form. REST API Extensions are xref:resource-management.adoc[manage] as resources.

If you want to learn how to create REST API Extensions, refer to the documentation page about Bonita Studio xref:rest-api-extensions.adoc[tooling for creating and testing REST API Extensions] (for Bonita subscription edition).

Page below contains information about deploying a REST API manually, which is possible with all editions.

== Deploy a REST API Extension

You need to deploy the REST API Extensions zip archive using Bonita Portal:

. Connect to the Bonita Portal and switch to "administrator" view.
. Go to Resources. You will see the list of all resources, and a filter for each type of resource (Pages, Forms, Layouts, Themes and REST API Extensions).
. Click Add button (top left).
. Click in the Archive field, then select the REST API Extensions zip file.
. Click Next.
. Click Confirm. The resource is added to the portal

REST API Extensions use the same authorization mechanism as the standard Bonita REST APIs. When you import the extension, the information in `page.properties` is used to create the appropriate resource permission mappings in Bonita (see xref:rest-api-authorization.adoc[REST API authorization] for information about REST API security configuration).

[NOTE]
====

It is also possible to deploy a REST API Extensions using xref:portal-api.adoc#page[REST portal API / "page" resource].
====

[NOTE]
====

The deployment of the REST API Extensions should always be made from the portal or its APIs, not directly from Engine APIs. Notably, the createPage() method of the Engine PageAPI would allow you to deploy a REST API Extensions, but would not update the security settings, meaning that you would not be able to access it at runtime.
====

[WARNING]
====

If you are running Bonita in a cluster, after you import a REST API Extensions, you must restart the application server on all the cluster nodes.
====

[WARNING]
====

As the deployment of the REST API Extensions automatically creates the appropriate resource permission mapping, be careful not to xref:BonitaBPM_platform_setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[push a configuration] that does not contain the latest permissions updates. This would overwrite the deployed configuration. To avoid doing so, pull the latest configuration, edit the needed elements and push it back to the Bonita runtime in a pretty short amount of time.

[#usage]

== Usage

A REST API Extensions must be deployed before any page or form resource using it is deployed.

A page that uses REST API Extensions must add the required resources in the page resource `page.properties` file.
For example, if a page uses the demoHeaders, demoXml, and putResource API extensions, its `page.properties` must include this line:

[source,properties]
----
resources=[GET|extension/demoHeaders,POST|extension/demoXml,PUT|extension/putResource]
----

If the page declares its resources correctly, then every user being able to access this page (because it is part of a custom profile or Living Application they have access to)
will also be automatically granted the necessary permissions to call the REST API Extensions. This works the same way as with the other resources of the REST API. +
However, if you need to grant access to this REST API Extensions to some users regardless of the pages they have access to, then you need to add xref:rest-api-authorization.adoc#custom-permissions-mapping[custom permissions] for these users. +
In order to do so, edit `custom-permissions-mapping.properties` to give the permissions (value of the property `apiExtension.permissions`) declared in the page.properties of the REST API Extensions to the required profiles or users.

[NOTE]
====

REST API permissions are stored in the user's session and new permissions will only be effective for a user the next time he logs in to the portal.
====

[WARNING]
====

In Bonita Studio, the debug mode is enabled by default. In debug mode, you can see changes on your REST API Extensions without importing a new zip archive, but it means the class of the extension is reloaded at each request. +
If you want to disable the debug mode, you need to use the setup tool provided in `workspace/tomcat/setup/` to set `custom.page.debug` to `false` in `console-config.properties`. (Update the file database.properties first so it points to the target database. E.g.: h2.database.dir=../../*PROJECT_NAME*/h2_database).
====

== REST API Extensions examples

A REST API Extensions example resource and API extension viewer page are provided in administrator portal. They are located in administrator portal.

To use the examples, define a xref:rest-api-authorization.adoc#custom-permissions-mapping[custom permissions] mapping for `demoPermission`:

In a Tomcat / WildFly bundle:

* Retrieve platform configuration using the xref:BonitaBPM_platform_setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[setup tool].
* Edit `platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal/custom-permissions-mapping.properties`.
* Add the following line: `profile|User=[demoPermission]`.
* Push the changed platform configuration into database using the _setup tool_.
* Restart Tomcat bundle

In Bonita Studio:

* Open the `custom-permissions-mapping.properties` from Development menu > REST API Extensions > Edit permission mapping
* Add the following line: `profile|User=[demoPermission]`
* Save the file
* Logout from the current session and log back in

REST API Extensions examples show how to:

* Customize response with additional header, cookie and response code
* Get resource return a simple echo of query parameters
* Use a SLF4J logger
* Post resources with Json payload and return a simple echo of parameters
* Return an XML content with specific media type and character set
* Call to external SOAP webservice (requires internet connexion)

Another REST API Extensions example with SQL data source is available on http://community.bonitasoft.com/project/data-source-rest-api-extension[Bonitasoft Community]. This example show how to execute SQL queries on a external database.
