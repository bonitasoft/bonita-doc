= Organization Management at runtime

:description: This pages describes how to get information about the users and make minor changes during runtime.

{description}

In Bonita Super Administrator and Administrator Applications, a user with the adequate access rights can view all the entities of the deployed organization. +
In practice, this includes groups and sub-groups, roles, personal and professional data about the user, Custom User Information on users, the date and time of the user's last login.

Super Administrator and Administrator can also perform some changes in the organization entities. +

[CAUTION]
====

Note that most modifications at runtime should be performed though a change in the project sources, to create a new project version. +
This new version can then be deployed through Bonita Continuous Delivery. +
This methodology guarantee the consistency between the project sources and the deployed version, making all subsequent changes much easier and error-proof. +

What the Super Administrator Application allows are emergency changes to recover from an urgent issue. All changes performed through this application must be backported to the project sources and versioned. +
