= Bonita BPM Engine architecture overview

This page describes the Bonita BPM Engine.

== Overview

The Bonita BPM Engine is the runtime processor at the core of Bonita BPM.  It executes processes, handling actions related to tasks, such as database access, and housekeeping actions such as logging. The Engine is composed of a number of services and APIs. The services are either BPM services or generic services.

image::images/images-6_0/dev_arch_engine_architecture_simple.png[engine architecture diagram]

The Bonita BPM Engine component services are completely configurable using the xref:BonitaBPM_platform_setup.adoc[plaform setup tool] to retrieve the current configuration and update it.

Services are provided to the Engine using a ServiceAccessor. By default, this uses Spring to bind services and to retrieve service instances.
The Spring configuration files are present in the classpath but beans can be added or overridden using configuration files stored in database under the *CONFIGURATION*  table.
These files are all suffixed with -custom.xml and contain Spring bean declaration examples.
Theses files can be retrieved and updated using the xref:BonitaBPM_platform_setup.adoc[platform setup tool].

Folder  `setup/platform_conf/[initial|current]/tenant_template_engine` contains tenant-level template configuration files used when creating a new tenant (Subscription edition):

* `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` : contains as comments all the available properties that can be overridden at tenant level.
* `bonita-tenants-custom.xml`: XML file can be modified to add any Spring bean you need to add/override at tenant level.

Folder  `setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/[TENANT_ID]/tenant_engine` where `[TENANT_ID]` is your tenant id (e.g. `1`). Contains same files use for an already existing tenant.

The Engine can be installed on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), in any web/Java EE container, or can be used as a simple Java library.

== APIs

This section contains a summary of the Bonita BPM Engine APIs. For details of the APIs, the methods and related objects, see the
http://documentation.bonitasoft.com/javadoc/api/${varVersion}/index.html[Javadoc].
| | |
|:-|:-|
| Identity API | Manages information about an organization, that is, the set of users who can act in processes. Handles creation, modification, and deletion of organizations, groups, roles, memberships, and users.| +
| Organization API | Import or export an organization.| +
| Process API | Handles actions related to processes (deploy, enable, start, disable, delete), executes activities, updates process data, search for a retrieve process entities.| +
| Login API | Logs in to the engine in a platform and creates a session.| +
| Monitoring API | Retrieves information about current activity, such as the number of users logged in, or the number of processes currently being executed.| +
| Log API | provides access to business logs, for searching and to retrieve information about current or archived processes.| +
| Platform command API | Creates, starts, stops platform.| +
| Document API | Manages documents that are attached to a process instance.| +
| Theme API | Manages the Look & Feel of the Bonita BPM Portal web and mobile interfaces and forms.| +
| Tenant Management API | Used to pause service in a tenant for maintenance, to resume service, and to check whether a tenant is paused. Available in Teamwork, Efficiency, and Performance editions.|

There is also a Web API, which is for internal use only, and a Command API, which is primarily for internal use.

| Evaluate an expression using the evaluator provided by another service (but do not evaluate dependencies of the expression). This service is extended by evaluators specific to the kind of expression to be evaluated. For example, in the Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, the ParameterService contributes an evaluator to evaluate expressions that reference a parameter. To add a new kind of expression, contribute a class implementing org.bonitasoft.engine.expression.ExpressionExecutorStrategy to the ExpressionExecutorStrategy class.

| Handle storage of objects in a persistent medium. There are two services, bonita-persistence-read for reading objects and bonita-persistence-api for reading and writing objects. The default implementation stores objects in the database, but the service could be implemented for any other type of persistent storage. The persistence service gives a unique identifier to an object.

| Used by:
| All services reading persistent objects (such as processInstanceService) use bonita-persistence-read. All services creating or modifying objects use bonita-persistence-api.

| Implementation:
| Hibernate
|===

| org.bonitasoft.engine.profile.impl.ProfileServiceImpl

| Notes:
| Uses persistence service to store privileges

| Description:
| Handle jobs and ensure that they are executed at the required time. There are three kinds of trigger: OneShotTrigger to execute a job once only at a given time, RepeatTrigger to execute a job a finite number of times at a given interval, and CronTrigger to execute a job according to a Unix-type structure.

| Used by:
| ProcessEngine, for timers and for launching the job that matches a message event

| Implementation:
| QuartzSchedulerService, org.bonitasoft.engine.scheduler.impl.SchedulerServiceImpl

| Notes:
| Relies on Quartz to launch jobs
|===

[discrete]

| TechnicalLoggerSLF4JImpl

| Notes:
| Implementation based on SLF4J
|===

[discrete]
==== Work

|===
|  |

| Description:
| Trigger work for immediate execution but asynchronously.  Unlike the scheduler service, which uses persistent storage, the Work service stores data in memory for better performance. This means that clients of the service must handle restart if a triggered work does not complete. For example, if the JVM shuts down, when it restarts the client must check for incomplete work and re-trigger it.

| Used by:
| ProcessExecutor, to trigger work to execute flow elements one after another

| Implementation:
| org.bonitasoft.engine.work.ExecutorWorkService

| Notes:
| Trigger launches work in a ThreadPool. For Community Edition, work items are launched in sequence, each one in a new thread. For Teamwork, Efficiency, and Performance Editions, work items are triggered in multiple threads.
|===

|  |

| Description:
| Parse and write XML files.

org.bonitasoft.engine.xml.SAXValidator (validate using sax) +
org.bonitasoft.engine.xml.DOMWriter (write using DOM)
|===

== Packaging

The Engine is provided as three .jar files:

* bonita-common contains code that is used by both the server and client sides of the application.
For example, the API interface is accessed both on the server side, which contains the API implementations, and on the client side, which has a proxy on the API. It also contains objects such as BusinessArchive, which is the JavaObject representation of a .bar file.
* bonita-server contains code used on by the server. For example, it contains service implementations, the services accessor, and API implementations.
* bonita-client contains client-only code. For example, it contains the Accessor service for the APIs, which is not in the common or server packages to prevent the server code calling the client-side API accessor.

In the Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, these jar files are bonita-common-sp.jar, bonita-server-sp.jar, and bonita-client-sp.jar.
