This page defines what the elements are within a Bonita Automation project as well as how some of the are structured to create a Living Application.

An automation project can be of different kinds. 
We like to promote the Living Applications based on process execution, because it takes advantage of the full potential of Bonita. +
But it can also by about process execution using the Bonita provided applications, with no need for a custom application. +
Or about process execution with no application, when the process is about automated tasks (and robots) only.

Among those elements, some are the *main* elements: they fully enter in the definition of the automation projects. +
A citizen developer in the project team (business analyst, business project manager, power user) can create most of them in Bonita. +
Most of the time, an example is provided or easy to download so you do not start from scratch. +
As Bonita is a really open platform, you will see that for some, an alternative is available outside of Bonita, that will require professional developers' work.

The others elements are *extensions*. They need some code to be written. +
To give full freedom to the professional developers, they can be created with other tools than Bonita and added to the project when needed.

For an Automation Project with no application, the last 4 elements are not needed.

== How main elements fit together

This image shows what an automation project looks like when it is about creating a Living Application:

// {.img-responsive}

All elements are structured in five sets: _Process_, _Users_, _Application descriptor_, _Resources_, and _External dependencies_. +
In this organization, some elements are referenced by others (in an aggregation relationship), and some belong to others (in a composition relationship). +

== Extensions
Those are developed in the developers' favorite IDE.

* Connectors
* Actor filters
* REST API extensions
* Custom themes
* Other dependencies

== Maven as our way to compose the project
