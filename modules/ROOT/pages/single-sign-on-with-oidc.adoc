= OpenID Connect SSO configuration
:description: Bonita can be configured to use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol to provide single sign-on (SSO), as long as you already have an OpenID Connect Identity Provider server up and running (IdP). OIDC is an extension of OAuth 2.0. Contrary to the SSO support of SAML2, both Bonita Web User Interface and Bonita REST API can be secured and accessed using the OIDC/OAuth protocols (versus just the Web User Interface for SAML2).

====

This information applies to a Bonita platform deployed from a bundle, not to the Engine launched from Bonita Studio. `<BUNDLE_HOME>` refers to the root directory of the bundle.

OpenID Connect configuration is at tenant level. Each tenant can use a different authentication method (over OIDC or not).

[NOTE]
====

Bonita uses http://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] OIDC Service client adapter. It has been extended to support other OIDC providers than Keycloak.
====

== OpenID Connect overview for Bonita

Only the *Authorization Code Flow* of OpenID Connect is supported. Not the *Implicit Flow*.

This is an overview that describes the steps of the authentication process on a Bonita bundle configured as an OIDC client:
[#oidc-overview]

image:images/oidc-overview.png[Authentication over OIDC]
// {.img-responsive}

Here some details about the Bonita OIDC module,
it is composed of:

* A servlet filter that intercept all the requests to Bonita portal pages
+
It checks if the user is already logged in on Bonita

 ** If already logged in \=> Allow the access
 ** If not logged in \=> Redirect to IdP (with scope, client Id, redirect URI, and `code` response type)

* An Implementation of the Authentication Manager extension point that retrieves the authentication information in the requests to log in to Bonita engine with the right credentials.

[WARNING]
====

Bonita `username` should match the `prefered_username` or one claims returned by the OIDC provider in the JWT token in the response.
 If some users need to be able to log in without having an account on the IdP, you can authorize it by activating an option in the file `authenticationManager-config.properties` (see 2. below). Users will then be able to log in using the portal login page (`/login.jsp`) provided they have a Bonita account and their password is different from their username. +
 You can configure Bonita engine to create the accounts on the fly in the database once a user accessing Bonita has been authenticated with the IdP (see the configuration of `bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties` in the 3rd section of the next chapter).
====

== Configure Bonita Bundle for OIDC

You need to execute the following actions in the folder of each tenant for which you want to support authentication over OpenID Connect.
If you want this configuration to also apply to each tenant created later, make sure to also perform those actions in the _template_ tenant configuration folder:
`<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_*` (if you have not started the Bonita bundle yet, the files are located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_*`)

The bundle already contains the files needed to use OIDC with Bonita platform.
To configure Bonita for OIDC:

. If you do not already have one:
 .. Download a Subscription edition bundle from the customer portal
 .. link:_basic-bonita-platform-installation[Configure] it as needed
 .. Run it a first time, so that the first default tenant is created (TENANT_ID = 1)
 .. Stop it and run `setup[.sh][.bat] pull` to retrieve current configuration before modifying the configuration files below
. In the tenant_portal folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal`,
edit the `authenticationManager-config.properties` as follows:
+
----
    -->  #auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.standard.StandardAuthenticationManagerImpl
         (...)
    -->  auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.oidc.OIDCAuthenticationManagerImpl
    -->  oidc.filter.active = true
    -->  oidc.auth.standard.allowed = true
    -->  oidc.logout.url = http://localhost:9090/auth/realms/bonita/protocol/openid-connect/logout
    -->  oidc.logout.url.redirectQuery = ?redirect_uri={encodedRedirectUri}
    -->  auth.tenant.admin.username = install
    -->  auth.passphrase = BonitaBPM
         (...)
    -->  auth.tenant.standard.whitelist = william.jobs
         (...)
    -->  logout.link.hidden=true
----
+
Make sure to link:multi-tenancy-and-tenant-configuration#toc2[set the right tenant admin username].
 It is recommended to also replace the value of the passphrase (property `auth.passphrase`) which is used by the engine to verify the authentication request.
 The value must be the same as in the file *bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties*. +
 If you need users to be able to log in without having an account on the IDP, you can authorize it by setting the property `oidc.auth.standard.allowed` to true. Users will then be able to log in using the portal login page (`/login.jsp`) provided they have a Bonita account and their password is different from their username. +
 If only a limited group of users need to bypass OIDC authentication method you can restrain it by setting the property `oidc.auth.standard.allowed` to false and setting the property `auth.tenant.standard.whitelist` with the list of authorized usernames (comma separated). Otherwise you can keep it commented.

. In the tenant_engine folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_engine/`
  edit the file bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties as follows:
+
----
         # Authentication service to use. Some are natively provided:

         # If authentication.service.ref.name equals "passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService",
         # you need to configure the following passphrase
    -->  authentication.service.ref.passphrase=BonitaBPM

         # Create users on the fly, when they are missing from bonita but authenticated by the SSO. The user will belong to the group and role specified below.
         #authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.enable=true
         #authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipGroupPath=/ACME/HR
         #authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipRoleName=member

         # CAS authentication delegate : enables the user, providing login/password,
         # to be logged in automatically against CAS web application

         #authentication.delegate.cas.server.url.prefix=http://ip_address:port
         #authentication.delegate.cas.service.url=http://ip_address:port/bonita/loginservice
----
+
It is recommended to also replace the value of the passphrase (property auth.passphrase). The value must be the same as in the file *authenticationManager-config.properties* updated previously.
+
If you want Bonita engine to create the accounts on the fly once a user accessing Bonita has been authenticated with the IdP, you can uncomment the property `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.enable` (and set its value to true) as well as the next 2 properties to add a default membership to each user account:

 ** `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipGroupPath` specify the group in which every user account created on the fly will be added (the full group path is needed)
 ** `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipRoleName` specify the role to use to create the membership

+
NOTE: Activating this option means any user authorized by the IdP to access Bonita will have an account created automatically in Bonita Database.

. In the tenant_portal folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal`, +
 edit the file *keycloak-oidc.json* to setup Bonita webapp as an OIDC client working with your OIDC provider.

 ** The property `realm` is only required if you use a Keycloak server as OIDC provider or if you want to benefit from the templating in the `*-url` properties (\{realm-name} will be replaced with the realm value). If you use a Keycloak server, make sure you set it with the name of the realm in which your Bonita OIDC client is/will be created.
 ** `resource` is the OIDC client Id given to your Bonita installation. You can change it if you want but you need to provide it to your OIDC provider.
 ** `auth-server-url` is the base URL of the OIDC provider server. All other service endpoints URL values can reuse this base URL with the placeholder``+{auth-server-url}+``.
 ** `auth-url` needs to be set with the URL of your OIDC provider Authorization endpoint. It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the end point or be a full absolute URL. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `token-url` needs to be set with the URL of your OIDC provider Token endpoint. It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the end point or be a full absolute URL. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `logout-url` needs to be set with the URL of your OIDC provider Logout endpoint. It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the end point or be a full absolute URL. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `token-issuer-uri` needs to be set with the URL that will be used as issuer in the JWT tokens (`iss` claim). It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the issuer URI or be a full absolute URI. For example using Google's OIDC provider, the issuer is `https://accounts.google.com`. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `user-info-url` needs to be set with the URL of your OIDC provider userInfo end point. It is only used when accessing a resource with a Bearer `Authorization` header with an access token that is opaque (not a JWT) and cannot be validated or used to retrieve the logged in user claims. It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the end point or be a full absolute URL. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `jwks-url` needs to be set with the URL of your OIDC provider JSON Web Key Set endpoint. It can be prefixed with `+{auth-server-url}+` to only indicate the path of the end point or be a full absolute URL. For example with Google as OIDC provider, this URL is `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `jwt-access-token` indicates if the access token is a JWT. If false, it will be considered by Bonita OIDC module as an opaque token and its validation and retrieval of the logged in user principal name will be delegated to the userInfo endpoint (see `user-info-url`). This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** `scope-values` can be used to set the value of the `scope` parameter sent to the OIDC provider in the authentication request. The scope value `openid` is automatically added if it is no present, but you can add other scope values like `email` or `profile` depending on you OIDC provider configuration and the claims you need in the JWTs to match Bonita username. This property is specific to Bonita OIDC module and is not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** Some OpenID Connect providers do not support having a pattern of valid redirect URIs. It is the case with Google's for example. With those providers you can use the `state` parameter to pass the target URL (the URL you initially requested and want to be redirected to). In order to do that set the property `save-target-url-in-state` to `true`. When you do that, the redirect_URI query parameter will always be the same. Its default value is the path `/bonita/keycloak` on Bonita server, but you can set a different value using the property `redirect-uri-path`. Make sure this URL is part of the valid redirect URIs in you OIDC provider configuration for the Bonita client. When `save-target-url-in-state` is set to `false` or not present, the `redirect_URI` query parameter is used to save the target URL. Those properties are specific to Bonita OIDC module and are not supported/documented by Keycloak.
 ** the `ssl-required` property value may need to be changed if Bonita Portal and the IdP are not both accessed via HTTPS. Possible values for this property are: `all`, `external`, and `none`. For `all`, all requests must come in via HTTPS. For `external`, only non-private IP addresses must come over via HTTPS. For `none`, no requests are required to come over via HTTPS.
 ** the `principal-attribute` value indicates the OIDC ID Token attribute/claim (`preferred_username`, `sub`, `email`, `name`, etc...) to use to be considered as user identifier in the client application. It should match the username in Bonita.
 ** `public-client` needs to be set to `false` if the OIDC provider requires the client requests to be authenticated (with a client secret for example). In this case you also need to use the `credentials` property. If this property is set to `true`, then no client Authentication header will be sent to the OIDC provider.
 ** `enable-cors` is required only if you wan to be able to use Bonita REST API from a web application located on a different domain from your Bonita installation's. It comes with additional options `cors-max-age`, `cors-allowed-methods`, `cors-allowed-headers`, `cors-exposed-headers`. You can check Keycloak https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_java_adapter_config[client adpter config documentation] for more information.
 ** `credentials` you can set it with an object containing either a `secret`,`jwt` or `secret-jwt` attribute if Bonita client is configured with a confidential access type in the OIDC provider (`public-client` is set to `false`). See https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_client_authentication_adapter[Keycloak's client authentication documentation] for more information.
 ** Some additional properties no present in the default file can be useful:
  *** `connection-pool-size` for the pool of connection to the OIDC provider server (20 by default)
  *** `truststore` path to a truststore file for OIDC provider servers requiring HTTPS. It should contain one or more trusted host certificates or certificate authorities. You can create this truststore by extracting the public certificate of the OIDC server's SSL keystore. This property is mandatory if you OIDC provider requires HTTPS unless you set `disable-trust-manager` property to `true`. If the truststore requires a password, you also need to add the property `truststore-password`.
  *** `client-keystore` path to a keystore file containing client certificate for two-way SSL when the OIDC client adapter makes HTTPS requests to the OIDC provider server. You also need to add the properties `client-keystore-password` (password for the client keystore) and  `client-key-password` (password for the client's key).
  *** `verify-token-audience` can be set to `true` to verify, when accessing the REST API with a Bearer authentication, that the access token audience (`aud` claim) contains the client Id (`resource` property). In Authorization Code Flow, this verification is always done and cannot be disabled. 
  *** `redirect-rewrite-rules` can be used to modify the path section of the redirect URI sent to the OIDC provider with the authentication or code exchange requests. By default the URI sent is the request URI as seen by Bonita OIDC module, but if Bonita is behind a reverse proxy for example, the path of the URI seen by Bonita OIDC module may be the one of the internal URI used by the reverse proxy and not the one of URI the OIDC provider needs to redirect the user agent (web browser) to. The value of this property is an object where each attribute key is a regular expression to which the Redirect URI path is to be matched and the attribute value is the replacement String. The other parts of the URI like the protocol, domain, port or query string cannot be modified. Here is an example removing "/bonita" from the redirect URI:
+
----
  "redirect-rewrite-rules" : {
    "^/bonita/(.*)$" : "/$1"
  }
----

[NOTE]
====

More configuration options can be found in https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_java_adapter_config[Keycloak official documentation]
====

If your Identity Provider is correctly configured (see the section _Configure the Identity Provider_), you are done.
Then you can try to access a portal page, an app page or a form URL (or just `http://<host>:<port>/bonita[?tenant=<tenantId>]`) and make sure that you are redirected to your Identity Provider to log in (unless you are already logged in). +
Note that if you try to access `http://<bundle host>:<port>/bonita/login.jsp`, then you won't be redirected to the OIDC provider's authentication end point since this page needs to be accessible in order for the tenant administrator (or another user if you set the property `oidc.auth.standard.allowed` to `true`) to be able to log in without an account on the Identity Provider.

[WARNING]
====

*Note:* If your Bonita platform is behind a proxy server, You need to make sure the reverse proxy is configured
to include the correct `Host:` header to the requests and the application server is configured to use this header (it is usually the case by default).
This is required so that `HttpServletRequest.getRequestURL` returns the URL used by the user and not the internal URL used by the reverse proxy. +
For example, if you are running Apache >=2.0.31 as reverse proxy, this configuration is controlled by the property http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost[ProxyPreserveHost].
If you need more fine tuning or if you cannot update the reverse proxy configuration, you can consult the official documentation for https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/common_howto/proxy.html[Tomcat]
====

== Configure the Identity Provider

Your OIDC identity provider (IdP) should declare an OIDC Service Provider named (or whose client Id is) `bonita` (or the value of the `resource` property set in the file *keycloack-oidc.json* of Bonita bundle if it is different ) with the following configuration or the equivalent depending on your IdP:

----
    "clientId": "bonita",
    "clientSecret": "your client secret",
    "baseUrl": "<your bonita server URL>", (for example http://my.company.domain:8080/bonita)
    "adminUrl": "<your bonita server URL>/keycloak", (for example http://my.company.domain:8080/bonita/keycloak)
  this URL is used by the server to communicate directly with Bonita service provider (to push revocation policies for example))
    "clientAuthenticatorType": "client-secret", (can also be "signed JWT" or "signed JWT with client secret" depending on your use case and security policies)
    "redirectUris": [
      "http://my.company.domain:8080/*" (those are the valid redirect URLs)
    ],
    "bearerOnly": false,
    "publicClient": false,
    "consentRequired": false, (or true if you want the users to have to consent if a third party app uses Bonita REST API for example)
    "standardFlowEnabled": true, (this is for the authorization code flow)
    "implicitFlowEnabled": false, (Bonita OIDC module does not support implicit flow)
    "directAccessGrantsEnabled": true, (or false if you don't want to use the Resource Owner Credentials Grant type to access the REST API)
    "frontchannelLogout": true,
----

If you use "Signed JWT" as the method of authentication for your bonita client you must either provide the public key or the certificate of the Bonita server to the OIDC provider or a JWKS URL where the OIDC provider can download the client’s public keys. Bonita OIDC module provides this service at the following URL: "http://my.company.domain:8080/bonita/k_jwks" +
You may also define some access or ID token signature and encryption mechanism. In this case, make sure to update Bonita bundle configuration file *keycloack-oidc.json* accordingly.

[NOTE]
====

If the IdP declares a redirect URI, it might override the target URL (`redirect_URI` parameter) set by the Bonita OIDC module in the request, and you may always end up on the same page after logging in. In that case, try to remove the redirect URI from your OIDC provider's Bonita client configuration. Bonita supports redirection to the URL initially requested after logging in on the IdP, provided the IdP doesn't force this URL.
====

== Configure logout behaviour

If your Bonita platform is configured to manage authentication over OIDC, when users log out of Bonita Portal, they do not log out of the OIDC Identity Provider (IdP).
Therefore they are not logged out of all applications that are using the OIDC provider.
To avoid this, you have two options :

[discrete]
==== Hide the logout button of the portal

This is the most commonly used solution. Users are logged in as long as they don't close their web browser (unless their session times out).
To do this, set the `logout.link.hidden` option to `true` in `authenticationManager-config.properties` located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_portal` for not initialized platform or `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_portal` and `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/[TENANT_ID]/tenant_portal/`.

[NOTE]
====

When a user logs out from the IdP directly, Bonita Portal's session will remain active. The user's session time to live will be reset
to the configured session timeout value upon each user interaction with the server.
====

[discrete]
==== Setup Bonita platform for OIDC logout

Global logout allows to log out from the OIDC provider as well as all the registered Service Providers when logging out from Bonita platform. This is sometimes required for example if users are on public computers.
As OIDC Providers do not necessarily support single logout and have different ways of handling it (there are several OIDC Single Logout methods), Bonita only offers OIDC logout through an OIDC logout URL that the IpP should provide and support.
To setup Bonita for OIDC logout:

. Set the value of the property `oidc.logout.url` with your OIDC provider logout URL in `authenticationManager-config.properties` located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_portal` for not initialized platform or `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_portal` and `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal/`.
. If the logout URL of your OIDC provider supports a parameter to redirect after the logout, you can set the property `oidc.logout.url.redirectQuery` with the query string to use (it will be concatenated to the logout URL). The placeholder `+{encodedRedirectUri}+` will be replaced at runtime with the current Bonita URL at the time on the logout action.

[NOTE]
====

If the logout flow supported by your OIDC provider is not the same as the one supported by Bonita platform, the preferred solution to handle it anyway is to intercept the requests to /logoutService and handle the logout programmatically.
====

== Troubleshoot

To troubleshoot SSO login issues, you need to increase the xref:logging.adoc[log level] to `FINE` for the packages `org.bonitasoft`, `com.bonitasoft`, and `ALL` for `org.keycloak` in order for errors to be displayed in the log files `bonita-*.log` (by default, they are not).

In order to do that in a Tomcat bundle, you need to edit the file `<BUNDLE_HOME>/server/conf/logging.properties.`

* Make sure the following lines are not commented or add them if they are not present (the syntaxe of the first line with `class\` is necessary because of the way the loggers are created in Keycloak):
+
----
class\ org.keycloak.level = ALL
org.keycloak.level = ALL
----

* Update the existing lines (to set the level to `FINE`):
+
----
org.bonitasoft.level = FINE
com.bonitasoft.level = FINE
----

[discrete]
==== Common error examples

*Symptom:* After configuring OIDC SSO in Bonita, the Bonita Portal login page appears and you are not redirected to the SSO login page. +
*Possible Solutions:*

* Check all the Bonita configuration settings are correct.
* Make sure `setup[.sh][.bat] push` has been executed and the server restarted after the changes.
* Try cleaning the cache and cookies of the web browser.

*Symptom:* Bonita portal URL profile and page parameters (or any other) after the hash (#) are lost in redirection. As a result once the OIDC login page redirects back to Bonita portal, the portal displays the first page of the default profile. +
*Problem:* The hash part of an URL is not sent server-side. It only exists in the web browser. That explains this behavior. +
*Solution:*
The workaround is to put the parameters as regular URL query parameters. Bonita portal has a mechanism that will convert them to hash parameters if they need to be (this only works since version 7.8.1 of Bonita). +
For example instead of `<server_URL>/bonita/portal/homepage#?_p=caselistinguser&_pf=2`, use `<server_URL>/bonita/portal/homepage?_p=caselistinguser&_pf=2`

== Manage passwords

When your Bonita platform is configured to manage authentication over OIDC, the user password are managed in your OIDC Provider (IdP).
However, when you create a user in Bonita Portal, specifying a password is mandatory. This password is ignored when logging in with the OIDC provider.

== LDAP synchronizer and OIDC

If you are using an LDAP service and the xref:ldap-synchronizer.adoc[LDAP synchronizer] to manage your user data, +
you can continue to do this and manage authentication over OIDC. +
The LDAP synchronizer user must be registered in Bonita (no need for an OIDC account). It is recommended though to use the tenant admin account.
We recommend that you use LDAP as your master source for information, synchronizing the relevant information with your Bonita platform.

[NOTE]
====

*Note :* By default the xref:ldap-synchronizer.adoc[LDAP synchronizer] sets the password of the accounts created with the same value as the username. So, even if you allow standard authentication (by setting the property `oidc.auth.standard.allowed` in *authenticationManager-config.properties*), users won't be able to log in with the portal login page directly without going through the OIDC provider authentication. +
====

== Using Bonita REST API with OIDC

When Bonita web application is configured for authentication with OpenID Connect, Bonita REST API is secured through OIDC too and it is possible to call it with an Oauth Access token.
To obtain the access token, there are several options depending on your OpenID Connect provider configuration and your use case:

[discrete]
==== Resource Owner Credentials Grant

In this scenario, the client application that needs to use Bonita REST API performs a request to the token end point of the OIDC provider with the username and password of the user account to use in Bonita. +
For example, using a Keyclaok server as OIDC provider, with a realm named `bonita` and a client Id `bonitaOIDC`:

----
  POST /auth/realms/bonita/protocol/openid-connect/token  HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:9090
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type:password
  password:<user IdP password>
  username:<user IdP username>
  client_id:bonitaOIDC
----
The token endpoint of the OIDC provider will answer with an ID and an access token.
Once you obtained the Access token, you can make your REST API request in a normal way, just adding a header `Authorization` with value `Bearer <Access token>` (replace the placeholder <Access token> with the token returned by the OIDC provider and make sure to keep the whitespace after `Bearer`).

==== Authorization Code Grant

Those scenarios work the same way as when you login on Bonita portal/apps except it is the client application that needs to use Bonita REST API which needs to trigger the authentication process by calling the OIDC provider authorisation endpoint with Bonita OIDC client as `client_id`. The rest of the scenario is similar to what is described in the xref:#oidc-overview[OIDC Authorization Code Flow schema]. +
With Authorization Code Flow, once you obtain the authorization code, you can request again the OIDC provider to get the tokens with as `grant_type` value `authorization_code`:

----
  POST /auth/realms/bonita/protocol/openid-connect/token  HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:9090
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type:authorization_code
  code:<your code from the OIDC response after user login/consent>
  client_id:<your client ID>
  client_secret:<your client secret>
----
The token endpoint of the OIDC provider will answer with an ID and an access token.
Once you obtained the Access token, you can make your REST API request in a normal way, just adding a header `Authorization` with value `Bearer <Access token>`.

[NOTE]
====

If the OIDC provider returns opaque access token (non JWT), then Bonita OIDC client module will use UserInfo OIDC endpoint to validate the token and retrieve the user claims. Make sure the property `user-info-url` is correct in the file `keycloak-oidc.json`.
