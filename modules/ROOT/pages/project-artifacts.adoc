This page defines what the artifacts are within a Bonita project as well as how some of the are structured to create a Living Application.

An automation project can be of different kinds. 
We like to promote the Living Applications based on process execution, because it takes advantage of the full potential of Bonita.
But it can also by about process execution using the Bonita provided applications, with no need for a custom application.
Or about process execution with no application, when the process is about automated tasks (and robots) only.

Among those artifacts, we consider some as *core*: they fully enter in the definition of the automation projects. +
For some, Bonita is the creation tool, and for some, a default version is provided. +
As Bonita is a really open platform, you will see that for some, an alternative is available outside of Bonita.

The others are *extensions*. They can be created on the side and added to the project when needed.

For an Automation Project with no application, the last 4 artifacts are not needed.

== Extensions
Those are developed in the developers' favorite IDE.

* Connectors
* Actor filters
* REST API extensions
* Custom themes
* Other dependencies

== Maven as our way to compose the project

== General view

This image shows what an automation project looks like when it is about creating a Living Application:

// {.img-responsive}

All artficats are structured in five sets: _Process_, _Users_, _Application descriptor_, _Resources_, and _External dependencies_. +
In this organization, some artifacts are referenced by others (in an aggregation relationship), and some belong to others (in a composition relationship). +




== Dedicated tools to create the artifacts
