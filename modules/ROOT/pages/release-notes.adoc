[NOTE]
====
The 2023.2 version is in development.
====

== New available values

=== Bonita Runtime 

==== User session sharing between nodes (Cluster)

When configuring a xref:runtime:overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster.adoc[Bonita cluster] (Enterprise and Performance editions only), HTTP sessions are now shared between all the nodes of the cluster. As a result, the load balancer no longer needs to be configured to use sticky sessions. If a node becomes unavailable, and a user request to this node fails, the user won't need to log back in as their session will remain active. The load balancer will dispatch the new requests to the other nodes.

[#maintenance-mode]
==== Maintenance mode

A new xref:runtime:platform-maintenance-mode.adoc['Maintenance mode'] replaces the 'pause/resume BPM services' feature.  +
The behavior when activating this mode is the same as what was happening when pausing the BPM services (making the BPM and BDM services and API unavailable to users aud pausing the scheduled work while updating the platform, BDM, apps, etc...) except the user sessions are no longer destroyed. A 'Platform under maintenance' 503 error page is displayed instead. Like the other Error pages, this page is part of Bonita App Directory application and can be modified with Bonita UI Designer.  +
In Bonita Super Administrator Application, the page 'BPM services' has been replaced with a new 'Platform maintenance' page allowing to activate/deactivate the maintenance mode and set a scheduled maintenance message to inform the users that a maintenance is scheduled and the platform will not be available for a while. This message, when activated, appears in Bonita Layout, as an alert header that can be hidden and in the user details modal. It also appears on the Maintenance page (503 error page) during the maintenance operations.  +
To benefit from this feature when updating to Bonita 2023.2, it is required to use the provided Bonita layout or to re-base your custom layout modifications on the provided Bonita Layout.  +
At REST API level, when the maintenance mode is active, the BPM and BDM API (except BDM installation) will respond with a 503 error. Bonita UI Designer pages now handle this error code and display a modal dialog informing the users of the running maintenance and proposing to redirect them to the maintenance page. To benefit from this feature when updating to Bonita 2023.2, it is required to migrate existing pages by migrating your apps using Bonita Studio 2023.2.

==== Exit on error

When starting a Bonita application, if an error occurs during the startup phase, the process will now exit with an error status code (`1`).

==== Default log pattern with color highlighting in console output

The default log configuration enables color highlighting in the console output.

=== Development suite

=== Bonita UI Designer

==== Session timeout and Maintenance handling

Bonita UI Designer pages now handle 401 and 503 errors for requests to Bonita REST API and display a modal dialog informing the users of the invalid session (401) or the running maintenance (503) and proposing to redirect them to the login or maintenance page. By clicking on cancel in this dialog, the users can remain on the current page (to not lose unsubmitted form content) and log in in an other tab to renew their session or wait for the maintenance to end.  +
To benefit from this feature when updating to Bonita 2023.2, it is required to migrate existing pages by migrating your applications using Bonita Studio 2023.2.

== Functional changes

=== REST API and file upload

When using the end point portal/fileUpload to upload a file before using it in Bonita REST API or a REST API extension, the size of the file that can be uploaded is now limited to 25MB. This can be changed in the configuration file `console-config.properties` using the setup tool, but be aware that this will affect upload limit for all users.

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== Legacy custom connectors and actor filters

Since Bonita Studio 2021.2 it was not supported anymore to create custom connectors or actor filters in a Bonita project. Using the project composition with Maven extensions is the recommended way to integrate custom extensions.  +
In this version, those deprecated custom extensions are removed from the project when importing a `.bos` file or cloning a Git repository from an older version.  +
If you were coming from an older version of Bonita Studio with those custom connectors and actor filters, it will be required to migrate them into a separate Maven project using the dedicated archetypes. Visit their respective documentation pages for xref:process:connector-migration.adoc[connectors] and xref:process:actor-filter-archetype.adoc[actor filters].

=== Provided Groovy classes

Deprecated since 2021.1, `BonitaUsers`, `BonitaSql`, `BonitaXML` and `BonitaTypes` Groovy classes are no more available. You may use suggested code templates in the Groovy script expression editor instead.

=== API Deprecations

==== Bonita artifacts creation and update

With the new Self-Contained Application (abbr. SCA) approach, creating or updating Bonita artifacts are done at Runtime startup. We recommend to use this new approach. So we deprecate some APIs, along with associated servlets and services, that are related to the creation or the update of Bonita artifacts.

== Configuration changes

=== Update only startup

A new `bonita.runtime.startup.update-only` configuration boolean property has been added to perform an update only startup.
When enabled, the application will start, go through its initialization and update phase and exit afterward. Exit status can be successful (`0`) or in error (`1`).

=== Properties source priority order

Prior Bonita 2023.2, properties files from database had priority over environment or system variables. We decide to reverse this order so that you can easily override database properties with environment or system variables, and to be in line with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config[Spring / Spring Boot philosophy].

To be backward compatible, we introduce the boolean property `bonita.runtime.properties.order.legacy-mode` (default: `false`) to enable the previous priority order of properties source.

=== Runtime property renaming

In order to improve Bonita property naming coherence, a work is in progress to change some property names.
In this release, the following properties have been renamed:

* [.line-through]#`bonita.tenant.session.duration`# has been renamed to `bonita.runtime.session.duration`. If you happened to customize this property, please update it in file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` (The old property is **still supported** but will be removed in a later version)
* [.line-through]#`userName`# has been renamed to `bonita.runtime.admin.username`. If you happened to customize this property, please update it in file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties`
* [.line-through]#`userPassword`# has been renamed to `bonita.runtime.admin.password`. If you happened to customize this property, please update it in file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties`
* [.line-through]#`TENANT_LOGIN`# has been renamed to `BONITA_RUNTIME_ADMIN_USERNAME`. If you happened to set this property in your Docker configuration, please update it (The old property is **still supported** but will be removed in a later version)
* [.line-through]#`TENANT_PASSWORD`# has been renamed to `BONITA_RUNTIME_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. If you happened to set this property in your Docker configuration, please update it (The old property is **still supported** but will be removed in a later version)

=== Removal of the property `install-provided-pages`

With Bonita 2023.1, we introduced the new concept of xref:2023.1@ROOT:release-notes.adoc#_bonita_project_packaged_as_a_self_contained_application[Self-Contained Application] (SCA). When building an SCA, Bonita Admin Application and Bonita User Application are no longer installed after the packaging process. If the SCA is using pages from one of those applications, setting the property `bonita.runtime.custom-application.install-provided-pages` and its relative environment variable for Docker `INSTALL_PROVIDED_PAGES` will have those pages installed anyway at Bonita Runtime startup.

Those two properties are no longer required and are removed. Instead, we detect the usage of Admin/User Application pages and install them automatically.

==== Setting a timezone for bonita container

The timezone can be set via *TZ* environment variable. Check the https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/zone1970.tab[supported timezones].
