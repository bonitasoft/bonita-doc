:description: Bonita release note

[NOTE]
====
The 2022.1 is in development.
====

== New values added

=== Bonita Test Toolkit (Subscription editions)

When working on complex, core, and critical automation projects it is critical to ensure the right business logic is applied.
Secure your automation project with the new development suite component: the Bonita Test Toolkit. 

This toolkit allows professional developers to write end-to-end or integration test scenarios for your automation project. It provides powerful methods to execute all the steps of a process and check the corresponding outputs (statuses, business data, tasks used)

It can be used in any IDE and can easily be integrated into a Continuous Integration.

More information in the dedicated documentation: Bonita Test Toolkit.

== Improvements

=== Runtime Health check endpoint

A health check endpoint has been added to the Bonita Runtime to help you monitor the status of your runtime.

This end-point is avaiable on the https://myruntime/bonita/healthz url and provides key information such the runtime status(OK, NOK), the platform state or the number of days until the license expiration.

Its access is now protected with Basic Auth authentication to protect against DOS attacks.

These credentials can be consulted and modified:

* in the <BONITA>/server/conf/tomcat-users.xml file in a *Bonita Tomcat bundle*
* using xref:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#_monitoring_username[specific Environment parameters] when starting a *Bonita Docker image*

== Functional changes

=== Prometheus monitoring active by default (Subscription editions)

From Bonita 2022.1, xref:runtime-monitoring.adoc#_prometheus_publisher[the Prometheus metrics publisher] is now active by default, and can be disabled if needed. +
Its access is now protected with Basic Auth authentication to protect against DOS attacks. +
Thus, when reaching the prometheus metrics endpoint, typically https://localhost:8080/bonita/metrics, you will have to manually enter the configured username and password information for your access to be granted.

These credentials can be consulted and modified:

* in the <BONITA>/server/conf/tomcat-users.xml file in a *Bonita Tomcat bundle*
* using xref:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#_monitoring_username[specific Environment parameters] when starting a *Bonita Docker image*


=== Dynamic authorization checking active by default (Subscription editions)

xref:identity:rest-api-authorization.adoc#dynamic_authorization[Dynamic authorization checking] is now only available in the *Enterprise* editions, and is also *active by default* for new installations. +
Existing installations that update to 2022.1 stay *unchanged*, but we encourage customers to activate dynamic authorization checking, once they have benched that the performance cost is reasonable.

For Community users who update to 2022.1, dynamic authorization checking does not work anymore. +
However, the configuration stays unchanged, even if it is not used anymore. +
If they want to reuse the configuration in a custom manner, or upgrade to Enterprise edition, the configuration will be back there and fully functional.

== Technical updates

===  Log4j2 Logger

Bonita Runtime now use Log4j2 as logger.
One of the great feature that it brings is the automatic reload of configuration files. There is no more need
to restart the platform if you only want to change a log level.
More information on how to use it in the docker image xref:runtime:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#logger_configuration[here] and in the bundle xref:setup-dev-environment:logging.adoc#_logging_configuration[here].


[WARNING]
====
If, in previous version, you customized the `logging.properties` file, you should update `log4j2-loggers.xml` as described in the documentation
xref:runtime:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#logger_configuration[here] and xref:setup-dev-environment:logging.adoc#_logging_configuration[there].

A conversion table between logger levels in JUL and in Log4j2 is available
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-jul/index.html[here]

If you want to continue using the previous log format, the previous pattern is present in the `log4j2-appenders.xml` file but commented out.

The Tomcat bundle does not log anymore in the console but only in `bonita.log` file. The previous behavior can be activated by setting the system property `-Dbonita.runtime.logger.sysout=Console` in tomcat's `setEnv.sh`
====

=== Docker image

Folder structure inside Bonita Docker images has been simplified: instead of having /opt/bonita/BonitaCommunity-{bonitaVersion} or /opt/bonita/BonitaSubscription-{bonitaVersion}, we now simply have */opt/bonita*. +
If you have scripts using the former folder structure, please update them.

The docker image does not create the database schema and the associated user anymore. The database must be created before the image starts. We provide pre-configured database images with already created existing schema and users https://hub.docker.com/r/bonitasoft/bonita-postgres

As a consequence, the following environment properties were removed:

* `ENSURE_DB_CHECK_AND_CREATION`
* `DB_DROP_EXISTING`
* `BIZ_DB_DROP_EXISTING`
* `DB_ADMIN_USER`
* `DB_ADMIN_PASS`

To rationalize the Bonita configuration variables, some properties have been renamed:

* [.line-through]#`REST_API_DYN_AUTH_CHECKS`# flag is replaced by `BONITA_RUNTIME_AUTHORIZATION_DYNAMICCHECK_ENABLED`. See xref:runtime:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#dynamic-check-enable[dedicated section] for details.

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== SVN
The SVN feature is now deprecated. We recommand that you migrate your repositories to a GIT repository. This xref:setup-dev-environment:migrate-a-svn-repository-to-github.adoc[page] describes how to migrate a SVN repository to Github.

=== REST API

* Deprecated: filter page using the `isHidden` attribute on the api `API/portal/page`. That field is not used anymore and is always false.
The platform produces a warning log if the filter is set and ignores it.
* Removed: the `ReportingAPI` is removed.

=== Multi tenancy Services

== Bug fixes

===Fixes in Bonita 2022.1

====Fixes in Bonita Runtime

* RUNTIME-178	- Case deletion throws 500 instead of 404 when the case does not exist.
* RUNTIME-4777 - Case overview does not paginate attached document list

== Known issues

=== Bonita Studio

* The `Run As JUnit test` action for Groovy REST API Extension project is broken (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=578535[Eclipse issue])
