=== Prometheus monitoring active by default (Subscription editions)

From Bonita 2022.1, xref:runtime-monitoring.adoc#_prometheus_publisher[the Prometheus metrics publisher] is now active by default, and can be disabled if needed. +
Its access is now protected with Basic Auth authentication to protect against DOS attacks.

== Technical updates

Folder structure inside Bonita Docker images has been simplified: instead of having /opt/bonita/BonitaCommunity-2021.2 or /opt/bonita/BonitaSubscription-2021.2, we now simply have */opt/bonita*. +
If you have scripts using the former folder structure, please update them.
