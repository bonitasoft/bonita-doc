:description: Bonita release note

[NOTE]
====
The {bonitaVersion} version is in development.
====

[NOTE]
====
The required Java version is now **Java 17**.
====

== New available values

=== Bonita Runtime

==== Java 17 update

Following the Java 17 update, it is now required to specify the following jvm arguments when using the `bonita-client` library in a standalone application:

[source, shell]
----
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
----

==== Docker image parent update

The `bonita` and `bonitasoft.jfrog.io/docker/bonita-subscription` images now inherit from the official https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin[eclipse-temurin] image in its alpine flavor. As a consequence, if you need to add additional Certificate Authority in the Java TrustStore you may proceed like xref:runtime:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#adding-ca-certificates[described here]. It also applies to xref:build-run:application-overview.adoc[Self Contained Application images].


==== Second-Level Cache available in a Bonita clustered environment

[NOTE]
====
For Subscription editions only.
====

Bonita {bonitaVersion} now handles second-level caching data (also known as L2 Cache) when running Bonita within a xref:overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster.adoc[cluster environment].

It is available by default with a preset configuration. It can be disabled by setting the property `bonita.platform.persistence.use_second_level_cache=false` or the environment variable `BONITA_PLATFORM_PERSISTENCE_USE_SECOND_LEVEL_CACHE=false`.

This L2 Cache mechanism is implemented with https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/cache/overview[Hazelcast]. At the same time, it replaces the Ehcache implementation that was previously used to support L2 caching data within a non-cluster environment.

For more information on how to tune the L2 Cache with Bonita, please refer to the xref:runtime:performance-tuning.adoc#persistence-cache[dedicated documentation].

==== Like-based search

Bonita Runtime search capabilities in APIs and application pages have been improved by changing the algorithm to support "like-based" search. +
With the "like-based" algorithm you can find all the matching records for which the search string occurs anywhere in a phrase or a word. +
This is now the default search behavior for all search APIs and pages of Bonita Runtime.

=== Development suite

==== Bonita Studio packaging changes

All Bonita Studio binaries now embed a Java runtime. The former "all-in-one" archive which was mixing both Windows and Linux environment will not be published anymore.

The Linux binaries are now published as `tar.gz` archives only, while Windows and MacOs platforms still uses an installer.
Consult xref:ROOT:bonita-studio-download-installation.adoc[Bonita Studio installation article] for more information.

=== Bonita UI Designer


== Functional changes

=== Oracle case-insensitiveness
The Oracle search is now case-insensitive.

=== REST API authorizations in Community edition

In order to improve security of Bonita Runtime REST API, the xref:identity:rest-api-authorization.adoc#dynamic_authorization[dynamic authorization mechanism] has been extended to Bonita Runtime community edition but it is limited to the set of provided rules and default configuration for Bonita REST API resources and cannot be extended. Customizing an extensibility (new PermissionRules definition) remains available in the subscription editions only.
Dynamic authorizations are active by default, and although it is not advised, it can still be deactivated to avoid 403 errors using a property (see xref:identity:rest-api-authorization.adoc#dynamic_authorization[dedicated doc page]).

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== Word-based search

The optional "word-based" and default "start-with" search algorithms cannot be used anymore as they have been replaced by a "like-based" search algorithm that is used in all search APIs and pages of Bonita Runtime.

=== API Removals

==== All editions

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Class#Method |Comment

|`org-com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PermissionAPI#checkAPICallWithScript(String className, APICallContext apiCallContext, boolean reload)`
|It was deprecated since Bonita 2022.1. Use `org-com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PermissionAPI#isAllowed` instead to execute both static and dynamic permissions check.
|===

== Configuration changes

=== Word-based search

Since "Word-based" search can no longer be used, its configuration has been removed. +
The properties `bonita.platform.persistence.platform.enableWordSearch` and `bonita.platform.persistence.tenant.enableWordSearch` are removed from the configuration file `platform_engine/bonita-platform-community-custom.properties` when using the update tool, and they no longer have any effect. +
If you used them to configure Bonita Runtime for "word-based" search and specified some objects to exclude using the bean `wordSearchExclusionMappings` in `platform_engine/bonita-platform-custom.xml`, you should remove this bean after updating since it is no longer used. The new "like-based" search is active on all objects that have API search methods.

=== REST API authorizations

The property allowing to enable/disable xref:identity:rest-api-authorization.adoc#dynamic-authorization-checking[dynamic authorization checks] has been moved from the configuration file `bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties` to the file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` in the tenant folder when using the setup tool. When updating Bonita in Subscription editions, if the property was used, Bonita update tool will keep its value. When the property is set using a system property or an environment variable, it will continue to override the value of the configuration file.
