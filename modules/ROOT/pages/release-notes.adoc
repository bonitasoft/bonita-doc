[NOTE]

====

== Improvements

=== Development suite changes

==== Bonita project

Bonita projects layout has been updated to take advantage of Maven multi-module project perks.

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== Custom Rest API Extension and BDM dependencies

When updating a Bonita project in the 2023.1 version, BDM dependencies are updated to use the new the `*-bdm-model` artifact introduced with the new Bonita project layout changes. This automatic update will replace previous `bdm-client` and `bdm-dao` dependencies with the project `bdm-model` dependency. 
In the process the dependency containing the client DAO implementation is removed from the dependencies list. 

It can affects the code directly referencing the `*DAOImpl` classes. To avoid this situation you may update this code to use the DAO interfaces presents in the `bdm-model` dependency. This change can be applied before or after updating to the 2023.1 version.

Reminder that if you were instantiating `*DAOImpl` class in your code, you should update it to use the `APIClient#getDAO` factory method instead.

.For example, for a given BusinessObject `Customer`
[source, java]
----
// Direct instantiation
CustomerDAOImpl dao = new CustomerDAOImpl(context.getApiSession());

// Replace it with APIClient factory
CustomerDAO dao = context.getApiClient().getDAO(CustomerDAO.class);
