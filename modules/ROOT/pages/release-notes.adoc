== New values added

=== No more migration between maintenance versions of Bonita

Starting with Bonita 7.11.0, it is not necessary to run the Bonita migration tool to upgrade between maintenance versions of Bonita Runtime
(to upgrade from 7.11.*0* to 7.11.*1*, for instance). +
More details on the new procedure xref:migrate-from-an-earlier-version-of-bonita-bpm.adoc#maintenanceVersionCompatible[here]

On the technical side, Bonita 7.11.0 introduces a loose couple between Bonita binaries and the Database schema it runs on.
There is now a distinction between Bonita Database Schema version and Bonita Runtime version.
The Bonita Database Schema version is a technical number (not accessible through APIs), that changes when the database schema changes.
The Bonita Platform Version is the 3 digit version number we usually use to refer to Bonita.
On startup Bonita now only checks if the database version is compatible with the binaries version, not if they are identical.

Aside of the quality of live update of not having to run a migration between maintenance versions, this update brings a few behavioral changes:

* Platform.getVersion() method still returns the version of the Bonita runtime binaries (ie. 7.11.0).
* Platform.getPreviousVersion() is now deprecated, and voided (will always return ""). It was not used anywhere. It will be removed in a later version.
* A check has been added in Cluster mode as to forbid the start of nodes in different Bonita platform versions. For example, on a two-node cluster, you can't have a node in 7.11.0 and another in 7.11.1.
The feature of having nodes in different Bonita versions was never supported, though there were cases where it "worked" in previous versions.

== Improvements

=== Development suite changes

==== Increase the default value of the development runtime's maximum memory heap size to 1Gb (512Mo previously)

To avoid memory issues with large bar files deployment the default xmx value has been increased to 1Gb. If you want to revert this change, you can change it in the Studio preferences \-> Server settings \-> Tomcat Maximum memory allocation.

[#uipath-cloud]

==== UIPath connector - Cloud support

The UIPath connector now supports the cloud solution.

==== Collaboration - Select the branches to clone

When cloning a project, gain time by selecting the branches you want to clone instead of cloning all the branches.

==== Description field on widgets

Add documentation to your pages by providing information on a widget (e.g. how to use it), thanks to the new Description field. Use this information to xref:release-notes.adoc#project-documentation[generate documentation].

[#connector-archetype]

==== Bonita Platform Extensibility: Connectors and Actor filters archetypes

You can now develop and test custom connectors and actor filters independently of the Bonita Studio.
Bonita offers maven archetypes to help bootstrap these extension points.

This is not limited to 7.11 and can be used from version 7.7
====

==== Bonita Purge Tool

A new open source project is available https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-purge-tool[here]. +
It cleans archived process instances older than a specific date. Allows to (potentially) reduce the size of a production database.
[NOTE]
====

This is not limited to 7.11 and can be used in previous 7.x versions.
====

=== Runtime changes

==== Monitoring

===== Messages

Two new metrics on BPM Messages are now accessible xref:runtime-monitoring.adoc[for monitoring purposes]:

* Potential: total number of potential couples, prior to duplicates removal. If this counter grows faster than the executed one, this indicates that we have lot of duplicates. See bonita.log for ids of duplicate couples.
* ReTriggerMatchingTasks: number of times we detect that there are more potential matches to be processed.
We retrieve the matches by batch of 100, a retrigger is performed if there are remaining potential matches.
This counter increases when they are remaining messages to be processed.
If this counter continues to increase, this means that we are continuously processing matches
(even if no new waiting events and/or messages have been created), so events processing is delayed,
i.e. new events/messages are not processed on the fly as it should in a nominal situation.

===== Connectors

There is now a configurable time threshold on connectors. When connector execution takes longer than the threshold, a warning is logged.
It allows identification of slow running services. +
The parameter is :

----
bonita.tenant.connector.warnWhenLongerThanMillis
----

More information xref:performance-tuning.adoc[here]

==== BDM Id generation
In Bonita 7.11.0, we changed the way ID's are generated when you deploy a Business Data Model or redeploy a new one. +
Previously, the strategy to generate table ID's of BDM objects was left to Hibernate to decide. It could be a database SEQUENCE, an auto-incremented column, ... +
Now, the specific implementation is explicitly set on each ID column during the BDM class generation. It is however different
from one Database vendor to another (a database SEQUENCE for Oracle and PostgreSQL, an auto-incremented column for MySQL and MS SQL Server). +
Note that no change is required from you, and upgrading to Bonita 2021.1 does not affect your already generated BDM until you actually redeploy it (next time you update it).

==== BDM Foreign key generation
In Bonita 7.11, the automatic name generation for foreign keys changes. It does not affect new BDM deployments, or already deployed BDMs. +
However, because of a bug (HHH-13779 in the underlying Hibernate library), redeploying a BDM causes those foreign keys to be generated a second time.
On Oracle, it is forbidden to generate such duplicated foreign keys, so the BDM redeployment operation fails. This is fixed in 7.11.6. +
On other supported Database vendors, the resulting schema in the database will have some duplicated foreign keys: foreign keys with a different name, but otherwise identical. +
Note: it will never generate more than two identical foreign keys, even after several BDM redeployment.
This has no effect on the behavior of either the Bonita platform, or the BDM. That said, you may wish to xref:migrate-from-an-earlier-version-of-bonita-bpm.adoc#fk_troubleshoot[clean your BDM database of these duplicated foreign keys].

== Bundle changes

=== Technical updates

Upgrade Tomcat from 8.5.47 to 8.5.53 (tomcat-dbcp from 9.0.16 to 9.0.31)

=== Oracle driver

The Oracle jdbc driver does not need to be downloaded separately anymore and is now packaged in the Bonita bundle,
 exactly like the Postgres, Mysql & SQLServer jdbc drivers.

=== Tomcat Manager removal

* the Tomcat Manager webapp is no more provided
* the bundle is not intended to be used to deploy extra webapps
* alternatives exist to deploy extra webapps if still needed

=== Tomcat root url redirected to Bonita

Simplify access to bonita by redirecting tomcat root to the bonita webapps.
For instance http://localhost:8080 redirected to http://localhost:8080/bonita

=== Single Bonita log file

All logs are now generated by default in a single `bonita.<date>.log` file.

This fixes the following issues that occurred in previous Bonita versions

* empty log files as their related webapps are not packaged within the Bonita Bundle
* some logs related to Bonita activities (in particular, jdbc drivers logs) are generated in `catalina.log`. This was
fixed from version to version, but most of the time, this was done only after receiving external feedback on bug
investigations (information were lost or hidden in catalina log file).
* complex logging configuration to handle which logs are generated to which log file
* hard to follow `localhost` logs and Bonita logs

Bonita monitoring-specific logs are still logged in a separate file (`bonita-monitoring.<date>.log`)

=== Thread name in Bonita logs

As of Bonita 7.11, the thread name information is added in `bonita.log` (by default, right after the logger name).
This helps tracking the processing when parallel requests are in progress specially since there is a single log file from Bonita 7.11.

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== Deprecations

[#portal-transformation]

==== Bonita Portal transformation

Bonita Portal is being transformed into Bonita Applications. When Bonita Applications are ready, Bonita Portal will be removed.
Developers and users will need to learn how to stop using the Portal and start using Bonita Applications instead.
This change will allow Bonita and its users to get free from Google Web Toolkit (GWT) technology and offer opportunities for customization.

Indeed, some Portal pages (built with GWT) are being totally recreated with our own UI Designer. They will be customizable.
Other pages (those that were already using another technology than GWT) are being wrapped and will not be customizable.

Moreover, as any Living Application, Bonita applications will be extensible to add any page the users need.
More details in the upcoming versions of Bonita.

Until then, we strongly advise not to create Custom Portal Profiles anymore but applications instead if possible.
When Bonita Portal does not exist anymore, the existing Portal Custom Profiles will need to be migrated into Living applications.

==== IE11 support

Internet Explorer 11 will soon not be supported anymore through the Bonita Platform.
The Development Suite already embeds features that are not compatible with IE11 (like the widget switch in the UI Designer).
Bonita Portal is still compatible with IE11 but will soon not be anymore.

=== Removals

=== Complex data-types generation have been removed

This feature was used to generate Java POJOs and XSD in Subscription editions. It is recommended to add your own Java model as jar file in the project classpath or create your xref:groovy-in-bonita.adoc#create-data-model[data model using Groovy objects].
