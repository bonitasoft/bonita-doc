[NOTE]

== Improvements

=== Development suite changes

==== Bonita project layout 

Bonita projects layout has been changed to take advantage of Maven multi-module project perks.

First project component that will benefit from Maven multi-module project is the Business Data Model. We decided to align the way the Business Data Model is handled in Bonita with the standard dependency handling practices by using Maven submodules. Submodules, or subprojects, are regular Maven projects that inherit from the parent POM. 

With the chosen solution, the users will have the possibility to publish and consume the Business Data Model java dependencies independently. The project will pull the required dependencies from a specified repository - Maven Central or Bonita Artifact Repository - to generate the BDM java sources.

Business Data Model content check at build or deploy will still be developerâ€™s responsibility along with handling data-deletion risks at build or deploy.
For this Bonita version, reusing the generated artifacts in another Bonita project is not supported with refactoring capabilities. All changes will have to be handled manually by developers.

== Feature deprecations and removals

=== Custom Rest API Extension and BDM dependencies

When updating a Bonita project in Bonota Studio 2023.1 version, BDM dependencies will be directed to use the new the `*-bdm-model` artifact introduced with the Bonita project layout changes. Meaning that `bdm-client` and `bdm-dao` dependencies will automatically be replaced with project's `bdm-model` dependency. 

Additionnally, the dependency containing the client DAO implementation will be removed from the dependencies list. It can affect the code directly referencing the `*DAOImpl` classes. To avoid this situation, change the code to use the DAO interfaces present in the `bdm-model` dependency. The changes can be done before or after updating to the 2023.1 version without breaking the project.

*Reminder* : in case `*DAOImpl` class was instantiated in the code, `APIClient#getDAO` factory method has to be used instead.

.For example, for a given BusinessObject `Customer`
[source, java]
----
// Direct instantiation
CustomerDAOImpl dao = new CustomerDAOImpl(context.getApiSession());

// Replace it with APIClient factory
CustomerDAO dao = context.getApiClient().getDAO(CustomerDAO.class);
