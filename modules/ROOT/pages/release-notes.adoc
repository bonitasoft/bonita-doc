== Improvements

=== Bonita Runtime 

==== User session sharing between nodes (Cluster)

When configuring a xref:runtime:overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster.adoc[Bonita cluster] (Enterprise and Performance editions only), HTTP sessions are now shared between all the nodes of the cluster. As a result, the load balancer no longer needs to be configured to use sticky sessions. If a node becomes unavailable, and a user request to this node fails, the user won't need to log back in as their session will remain active. The load balancer will dispatch the new requests to the other nodes.  


=== Development suite changes


=== Bonita UI Designer


== Feature deprecations and removals
