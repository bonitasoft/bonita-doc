This page explains what a user with the _Administrator_ profile can do with xref:profiles-applications-overview.adoc[profiles] in Bonita Portal.
In all Bonita editions, those users can change the mapping between a provided profile and the organization entities.
In Enterprise, Performance, and Efficiency editions, they can also create new profiles and edit them.

A popup reports the status of the import. It shows the number of profiles successfully imported, partially imported, or with errors.
[NOTE]
====

Note: The default profiles defined in Bonita have the flag `isDefault` set to "True" in the XML file. Do not change the setting of `isDefault` for any profile, or you will get an error message on import.
====
 .. To create, type the name and description, and click on the _Create_ button. This will take you to the details page.
Create the mapping with the organization entities, and if needed, create a Portal navigation.

[NOTE]
====

Starting with Bonita 2021.1, because Bonita Portal is deprecated, we strongly encourage to create applications instead of Custom Profiles with navigation for Bonita Portal.
====

== Delete a profile

Very rarely, the Administrator may have to delete a profile. It is not possible for Bonita default profiles. +
Deleting a profile will not delete the mapped entities, but if the custom profile has a Portal navigation, this will be deleted. +
To do so:

. Go to _Organization_>__Profiles__
. Click on the profile to delete
. Click on the _Delete_ button
