Learn how to set up a reverse proxy to expose Bonita web interface publicly while keeping the backend safe.

== Context

[WARNING]
====
Bonitasoft does not support anymore having Bonita portal running on a dedicated Tomcat server on one side, and Bonita Engine running on a dedicated Tomcat server on the other side.
====

If you have to expose Bonita Portal or a Bonita-developed application publicly, but legibly want to protect any
other resources behind your firewall, you should set up a software architecture similar to this one:

where the Web Server serves as a reverse proxy, and where the Tomcat server hosts Bonita.

== using Apache httpd

Apache HTTP server proposes the following infrastructure, with optionally several Bonita backend servers:

Read https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/reverse_proxy.html[the complete Apache httpd documentation] for detailed configuration capabilities.

An example of httpd configuration that works with Bonita could be:

`httpd.conf`:

```
RewriteEngine  on
RewriteRule    "^(?!/bonita)(.*)$"  "/bonita$1" [R,L]
RewriteRule    "^/(.*)"  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/$1" [P]
ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
```

== using NGINX

NGINX proposes the same functionality.
