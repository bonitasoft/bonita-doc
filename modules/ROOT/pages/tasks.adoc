= Manage Tasks

A task is an element of a process. It defines an action to be performed (automatic or human).

== Prerequisites

To manage a task as follows, you need to be logged on Bonita with the *Administrator* profile or the *Process Manager* profile.

== Assign a task

A task can be assigned and reassigned if necessary to another user.

. Go to *BPM* > *Tasks*
. Click on a *task in the list of tasks*
. Click _*Assign*_

== Unassign a task

. Go to *BPM* > *Tasks*
. Click on a *task in the list of tasks*
. Click _*Unassign*_

== Do a task for another user

With the Efficiency, Performance and Enterprise editions, an Administrator can do a task for another user. This is useful for unblocking a case if the assigned user cannot perform a task.

. Go to *BPM* > *Tasks* and view the list of pending Human tasks.
. Select the relevant task in the list and click *Do for*.
. In the popup, a list of users elligible to do the task is displayed.
. Select the user for whom you want to do the task, and click *_Do it_*.

The task is done as though the selected user has done it.

== Skip a failed task

If a failed task does not impact subsequent task in a process, the Administrator can skip it. This means that the task does not have to be done successfully for the following steps to become available.

. Go to *BPM* > *Tasks*.
. Go to *Failed*.
. Click on a Task.
. Click _*More*_.
. In *Technical details*, the reason for the failure is displayed
. Click _*Skip*_.

The task is moved from Failed to Done.

== Replay a failed task

This feature is available with the Enterprise or the Performance edition.

. Go to *BPM* > *Tasks*.
. Go to *Failed*.
. Click on a _*Task*_
. In *technical details*, the details of the failure are displayed
. Correct the reason for the error e.g. Connector parameters.
. Click _*More*_.
. Click _*Replay*_.
. In the popup window **Replay task **, tick the task which failed.
. Click _*Replay*_.

NOTE: You will need to fix any parameter causing the failure, *BEFORE* clicking on Replay.

See xref:processes.adoc[Modify a parameter]

== View the failure stack-trace message on a failed task

Normally, a user will start a case of a process. The case might not start as expected. This is a called a faliure.

In this case the Admin can check the failure on a connector:

. Logged in as Admin, go to *BPM* > *Tasks* > *Failed*
. On the Failed page, in the section Technical details, this shows the Connector has failed.
. Click on *More*

. There can be a list of connectors in different states. Here we can see the connector that has failed.

. Click on the *Failed* link.
. A pop-up window *Failure details* displays the error message and the details of the message.

There are 2 options:

* Either click the *Skip* button, to skip over the task where the connector failed. This will make the Failed message disappear on the Connector, and display Resolved instead.
* Fix the problem then click *Replay*.
