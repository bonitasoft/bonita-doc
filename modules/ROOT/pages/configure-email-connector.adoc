= Configure an email connector
:description: :experimental:

:experimental:

In order for a process to interact with external systems such as publishing a document on a CMS, calling a REST API, or sending an email, Bonita provides connectors. In our example we will configure an email connector to notify the manager that a task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ requires their attention.

[NOTE]
====

A connector is a piece of code that is executed when starting or finishing a process or a task. It will process input data (for example business variable values) and generate (optionally) some outputs. Connector code might only transform inputs but can also perform interaction with external systems.
====

In order to avoid settings that are specific to real email provider, we will use a tool for a fake email server "FakeSMTP":

. Download FakeSMTP from this https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/downloads/fakeSMTP-latest.zip
. Unzip the file
. Run FakeSMTP by double-clicking on the JAR file, or by running this shell command: `java -jar fakeSMTP-2.0.jar`
. When the user interface is displayed, set the *listening port* to _2525_
. Click on the *Start server* button.

Now that we have a fake server running, let's configure the email connector on the _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ task:

. Select the task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_
. Go to menu:Execution[Connectors in]
. Click on the *Add...* button
. Select the _Email (SMTP)_ connector
. Click on the *Next* button
. Name the connector configuration _Send notification_
. Click on the *Next* button
. Set the following parameter values:
 ** SMTP host: _localhost_
 ** SMTP port: _2525_ (the port number specified in FakeSMTP)
 ** SSL (in the *Security* section): _unchecked_
. Click on the *Next* button
. Enter `no-reply@acme.com` in the *From* field
. Use the image:images/getting-started-tutorial/configure-email-connector/pencil.png[pencil icon] icon to edit the expression of the *To* field
. Set the *Expression type* to *Script*
. Paste the following Groovy script into the code editing zone: `BonitaUsers.getUserProfessionalContactInfo(apiAccessor,taskAssigneeId).email`
. Click on the *OK* button
. Click on the *Next* button
. Set _You have a pending task_ as the subject
. Click on *Finish*
+

If you run the process with the connector configured, you should see a new incoming email in the FakeSMTP user interface when task _Deal with unsatisfied customer_ becomes available.

You have now a process definition that uses a wide range of Bonita features. In the xref:design-application-page.adoc[next chapters], we will create an application on top of this process.
