= Bonita Application Directory 
:description: This pages describes the Bonita _Application Directory_: its values, how to access it, and how to customize it. +

{description}

== Values

On the developer side, this application embeds error pages for 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 500 (internal server) errors. +
Those pages will be displayed for all applications, provided or custom, given such errors occur when trying to display a page. +

On the user side, the Application Directory displays all applications that the logged user has access to. +
The access rights are managed through xref:profiles-overview.adoc[profiles]. +
Since a user can be mapped to multiple profiles, and since each profile can be mapped to multiple applications, all users need a place to centralize all Bonita applications they can access. +

This application is diplayed when a user:

* accesses the root of Bonita web application (`/bonita` or `/` if context root is configured to target Bonita web application)
* lands on an error page and clicks on the "Go to homepage" button 

When a user uses valid URLs for Bonita, they can always access the list of their applications by using the mosaic icon to switch from the current to another application. +

== Access during Development and Testing phases

To access the application:

. Open Bonita Studio
. Click on the *Applications* icon of the coolbar

You will be logged in as the default user of the deployed organization. This default user can be changed by opening the organization editor. +
By default, in our provided ACME organization, the default user is Walter Bates, logged as "walter.bates", with password "bpm". +
The default application is the Application Directory.

To access its content: 

. From the Application Directory, click on the Bonita Administrator application (also accessible as Walter Bates)
. In the menu, click on "Applications"
. On the "Bonita Application Directory" row, click on the "..." _View application details_ icon 


== Status
This application is core to Bonita Platform. It is embedded in the Runtime and cannot be downloaded from the Studio nor be part of your automation project. +
This is the reason why you will not see it in the studio Project Explorer. +

Also, since it looks more like a page than an application, it does not use the "Bonita layout" but a "Layout Without Menu".
It is also the reason why the list of pages is fixed, and no navigation can be created. +

However, it is customizable in quite a few ways, as explained below.

== Customization 

On the application details page, you will be able to edit:

* the logo
* the layout
* the theme
* each of the error pages

To update the logo:

. Create the new one. Supported MIME types: XXX. Maximum size: XXX
. Click on the "Upload new picture" button below the current logo
. Select the new logo
The new logo is applied.

To update the layout and/or theme:
. Create a new xref:layout-development.adoc[layout] and/or xref:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[theme]
. Go the _Resources_ tab
. Install it 
. Go back to the application details
. Click on the current layout or theme
. Select the new one from the drop down list

The new layout or theme is applied.

The eroor pages have been created with the UI Designer. To edit them, you need to open them in the UI Designer:

. Click on the "Resources" menu option
. If needed, filter by pages
. On the row of the page you need to customize, click on the "pencil" _Export_ icon
. Save it locally (.zip archive)
. Back to Bonita Studio, open the UI Designer from the coolbar
. On the UI Designer home page, click on "Import" at the top left
. Select the error page .zip archive
. Click on the _Import_ button
. In the list of resources, make sure you read the _Pages_ tab, and click on the page name

You can start editing the page. +
To edit the image, edit the asset positioned right between the two titles. +
Here is an example of the image location from the "Error403BonitaV1" page:

image::images/edit-error-page-image.png[Edit the image in an error page]

Once you are done editing the page, update it in the Resources:

. From the UI Designer, save the page
. Export it
. Open the Administrator application > Resources menu
. On the row of the page to update, click the "pencil" _Update_ icon
. Browse for the new version of the page
. Click on the _Update_ button

The page is updated.
