= Bonita User Application
:description: This pages describes the Bonita User Application: its values, how to access it, and the details of its features. +


{description} +
The Bonita User Application allows anyone with the _User_ profile to view tasks and do them, get information and add comments on cases, get a list of processes to start.

== Value

We believe that Bonita Applications give our users freedom for customization:

* Their menus can be customized, by adding or removing pages, while still keeping the mapping with the _User_ profile
* These pages can also be modified in the UI Designer to fit precise users' needs.

== Access during Implementation

To get the application when you are implementing your Bonita project, go to the "Resources" tile of the *Studio Welcome page*, and click on "Import Bonita User Application".

You can also get it from our https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-user-application/[User Application GitHub repository]. +
There are two ways to get the .bos file. You can either get it from the _Releases_ on the right or by cloning the repository of your choice and building it using maven. +
Building the repository will create a .bos file in the `target` folder. You can import this one into the development environment.
 +
Using this method is also useful if you want to get an older version of an application or if you need a weekly version with a potential bugfix.

After Studio validation, the application is imported or cloned; you can view its content in the project explorer, deploy it, and open it.

== Access in pre-Production and in Production

To deploy the applications into a bundle or the Cloud, you can use https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bcd//_manage_living_application[Bonita Continuous Delivery] (for Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, and using BCD).
Alternatively, you can deploy an application by importing all its components in the following order:

* Organization then profiles
* API extensions then pages, layout, themes
* Business Data Model then processes
* Application descriptor

== Create your own User application from ours

. Have all your custom pages ready, either imported in Bonita UI Designer or Bonita Studio.
. Open our UI Designer pages to customize them.
. In Bonita Studio, go to the "Project explorer" on the left and double-click on the "bonita-user-application.xml" application descriptor.
. In the editor, rename the pages, change the order in the menu, remove the pages you do not need, add yours in the menu, or as orphan pages accessed through navigation from another page.
+
[WARNING]
====
Make sure our "details" pages are always used as orphan pages, as they need some parameters (usually just an ID) to be passed in the URL by a list or another page to show any content.
====
+
. To add other Bonita provided pages, open the Applications from the coolbar, go to the Bonita Administrator Application, and look in the "Resources" tab, filtered by pages.

[NOTE]
====

Once a page has been customized, or when the User application has been customized, it is no longer supported. +
But you can reach one of our Professional Services team member to help you develop or maintain it.
