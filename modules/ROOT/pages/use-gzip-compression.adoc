= Tomcat gzip compression
:description: This page describes how to activate gzip compression for a Bonita Platform with Tomcat.

{description}

Gzip compression can improve performance by reducing network load.

== Tomcat configuration

To activate gzip compression for http requests, you need to modify the `server.xml` configuration.

Open `server.xml` and find the Connector configuration corresponding to HTTP. Edit the section to add following parameters:

[source,xml]
----
compression="on"
compressionMinSize="X"
noCompressionUserAgents="Y"
compressableMimeType="Z"
----

|===
| Property | Description | Example

| compression
| Activates or deactivates gzip compression.
| on

| compressionMinSize
| The minimum size of resources to be compressed. It is not useful to compress resources that are already small.
| 2048               (default value)

| noCompressionUserAgents
| The User Agents for which compressions is not to be used. Some older browseers do not support compression.
| gozilla, traviata

| compressableMimeType
| The MIME types of the resources to be compressed. We recommend that all text files be compressed.
| text/html,text/xml
|===

If you use the Tomcat bundle, the file to edit is `BUNDLE_HOME/server/conf/server.xml`.
If you use a different package, use the corresponding path; for example on Ubuntu the file is located in `/etc/tomcat8/server.xml`.

Connector configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           maxThreads="100"
           redirectPort="8443"
           maxPostSize="-1"
           URIEncoding="UTF-8"
           compression="on"
           noCompressionUserAgents="gozilla, traviata" />
----

== Check changes

After you modify the file, restart your application server and test with the following `curl` command:
`curl -I -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' http://`_`ip_address:port`_`/bonita/login.jsp`

Check that the header returned contains the line `Content-Encoding: gzip`. The output should be similar to this:

----
HTTP/1.1 200
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Cache-Control: max-age=36000
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=031D2F9C4DBFAD48A19670AEF83A57E6; Path=/; HttpOnly
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Encoding: gzip
