[WARNING]
====
The script dependencies are fixed, i.e. when the process is implemented the developer designed the script to use some variables and/or parameters. The live update capability cannot go against this design and only allows to change the script content. If the new script tries to use more variables, it will lead to execution errors. To change the script dependencies (data available in the script execution context), the process definition must be updated and a newer version of the process deployed.

[#cache_busting]

== Cache busting

Cache busting has been introduced in Bonita 7.6, along with a new xref:cache-configuration-and-policy.adoc[cache policy].
It allows end users to benefit from custom page update without the need to empty the browser cache.
When you export a page or a layout from the UI Designer, we suffix the resource filename with a hash.
If the page is updated, the resource filename will change, and the browser will download it from the server, and not from the cache.

If you don't use the UI Designer to edit and export your custom page, don't forget to manually trigger the cache busting mechanism. It means that, as a developer, you must make sure to either change the file names of the modified resources (javacsript, CSS, images, etc...) or add a query parameter (e.g. ?version=2) to the URLs used in the HTML to access those resources. This way the web-browser will not use the version it has in cache but the new file instead.
Without this cache busting, end users won't benefit from the latest custom page changes, unless they empty their browser cache.
