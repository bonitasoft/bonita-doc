:description: How to build Bonita Community edition from the source
:page-aliases: ROOT:building-community-edition-from-source.adoc

Bonita is an opensource Digital Process Automation platform, you can therefore build Bonita Community edition from the source.

All source code of Bonita is available from the https://github.com/bonitasoft[Bonitasoft GitHub organization]. Each Bonita component has
a dedicated repository (e.g. https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-engine[Engine repository]).

== Manual Bonita build

You can build Bonita from component to component, but you have to know the component interdependencies: some components rely on components
that are built earlier in the sequence, so the build order must be respected. For instance, build `bonita-engine` prior to build
`bonita-web`.

=== Requirements

- Disk space: around 15 GB free space. Around 4 GB of dependencies will be downloaded (sources, 3rd party dependencies, ...). A fast internet connection is recommended.
- Java JDK 17 and git installed on your machine.

=== Building Process

This guide covers building Bonita from various repositories. For each component, you'll find a dedicated page with specific instructions.
