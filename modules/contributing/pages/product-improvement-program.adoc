:description: Learn about the telemetry data collected by Bonita Platform and how to disable it.

== Introduction

Bonita Runtime and Bonita Studio collect anonymous telemetry data that help Bonitasoft teams in understanding how the product is being used and in deciding what to focus on next.

The data collected is minimal, statistical in nature and cannot be used to uniquely identify a user. Please see the next section to see what data is collected and sent. Access to collected data is strictly limited to the Bonitasoft team and not shared with 3rd parties.

As a growing community, we greatly appreciate the usage data users send to us, as it is very valuable in helping us make Bonita Platform a better product for everyone! However, if you are concerned about sending usage stats, you can choose to disable telemetry as described xref:contributing:product-improvement-program.adoc#disable-telemetry[here].

== What data is collected?

=== Runtime

The runtime sends the executed connectors/actor filters id along with their input and output names. This allows us to understand which connectors are used and how they are configured.

  "definition_version": "1.0",
  "input_names": ["inputName1", "inputName2"],
  "output_names": ["outputName1", "outputName2"]
}

=== Studio

The studio sends the installed Marketplace extension id and version. This allows us to understand which extensions are used.

== Disable Runtime telemetry

You can turn off telemetry on the Runtime by setting the env variable `BONITA_RUNTIME_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE=disabled` or the system property `bonita.runtime.data-collection.mode=disabled`.
This property can also be set in the `bonita-platform-sp-custom.properties` file.

== Disable Studio telemetry

You can turn off telemetry on the Studio from the `Preferences > Advanced` panel and uncheck the `Contribute to Product Improvement Program` option. It will disable telemetry for the Studio and embedded Runtime.
