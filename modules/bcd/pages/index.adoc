Dear user,

With the introduction of our Self Contained Application approach, we are moving to a new deployment mode that no longer relies on the "BCD" mechanism as you have known it. In fact, SCA mode is natively integrating this capability into the “build” package.
Those changes impact our BCD component “adds-on” which will start a progressive phasing out process. It means that we progressively transition from it and that there will be no more updates or improvement in this feature.

The Continuous Deployment process is of course still part of Bonita’s offering but is relying on new methods
However, we want to reassure you about the timeline of this transition. With the update of the 2024.1 documentation, we confirm that the BCD will not be deprecated in either 2024.1 or 2024.2. versions. As a reminder, our versions are then supported for 2 years from their release date (which brings you to 2024.2+ 2 years).

We will keep you regularly informed on this matter. Additionally, a new documentation section has been created to guide you through this transition, along with migration recommendations that you can find xref:build-run:build-application.adoc[here].

We want to assure you that our teams are available to answer any questions you may have and to support you through this evolution. Please feel free to contact us for any further assistance.

BCD lets you build a Living Application from source code in a repository and deploy the generated artifacts, all from the command line.

== Basic concepts

*BCD* offer has evolved now into *two Java command-line interfaces (CLI)* which allow to `build` and `deploy` Bonita Living Applications. You will be able to download the latest versions of the CLIs from our xref:software-extensibility:bonita-repository-access.adoc[Bonita Artifact Repository] and then integrate the execution in your developer and CI pipelines.

IMPORTANT: *BCD features do not require docker anymore*. Usage is therefore greatly simplified. The only remaining xref:requirements-and-compatibility.adoc[prerequisites] are Java and Maven installed on the host running the CLIs.

TIP: For both CLIs you can have a look at the https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/[exec-maven-plugin] to include `build` and/or `deploy` step in the bonita project build lifecycle. (starting from version 7.13.x, a bonita project is a maven project) +
Currently you should consider the maven aspect as a black box, because the studio perform some instrumentation of the project's pom.xml file, but advanced users can still take advantage of the maven aspect of the project.
