= Bonita Continuous Delivery (Deprecated)
:description: Bonita tools for continuous delivery

:page-aliases: bcd_cli.adoc, bcd_controller.adoc, getting_started.adoc


CAUTION: As of september 2023 BCD deployer is deprecated. The deployer will continue to work for Bonita version supporting the platform mode like 2023.2 and 2024.1, but it will not evolve anymore, and support for future versions is not guaranteed. 
The Continous Deployment process is still part of Bonita's offering. It is now made at startup, through the self-contained application feature.   
For any information about the self-contained application feature, please contact your customer success representative.

BCD lets you build a Living Application from source code in a repository and deploy the generated artifacts, all from the command line.

== Basic concepts

*BCD* offer has evolved now into *two Java command-line interfaces (CLI)* which allow to `build` and `deploy` Bonita Living Applications. You will be able to download the latest versions of the CLIs from our xref:software-extensibility:bonita-repository-access.adoc[Bonita Artifact Repository] and then integrate the execution in your developer and CI pipelines.

IMPORTANT: *BCD features do not require docker anymore*. Usage is therefore greatly simplified. The only remaining xref:requirements-and-compatibility.adoc[prerequisites] are Java and Maven installed on the host running the CLIs.

TIP: For both CLIs you can have a look at the https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/[exec-maven-plugin] to include `build` and/or `deploy` step in the bonita project build lifecycle. (starting from version 7.13.x, a bonita project is a maven project) +
Currently you should consider the maven aspect as a black box, because the studio perform some instrumentation of the project's pom.xml file, but advanced users can still take advantage of the maven aspect of the project.
