:description: To provide continuity, regular backups of Bonita Runtime (clustered or not) are advised.

{description}

== Procedure

Any basic one node (non-clustered) installation can be backed up to be restored later.
In a xref:ROOT:overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster.adoc[Bonita cluster], you need to back up the nodes, the shared database.

A cold backup (total shutdown) is recommended, to avoid losing data being processed during the backup process. Note: make sure your database server is backed up.
(Please refer to the specific documentation for your database concerning the backup procedure).

. Stop the application server
. Save the Application Server configuration files modified during Bonita setup.
. Save the deployed web application (i.e. `bonita.war`) (for Tomcat `[BUNDLE_HOME]/server/webapps/bonita.war`), or you can redeploy all applications at startup.
If you decide not to save the `webapps` directory, make sure that you have a copy of your Bonita application available.
. Back up your database (Please refer to the specific documentation for your database concerning the backup procedure).
. Start the application server.
