Bonita Reporting app will enable you to view statistics and to extract process execution reports with meaningful data from Bonita, for process performance analysis and for pinpointing areas of improvement.


In keeping with Bonitasoft’s promise to continuously deliver valuable, high quality features, we had to relinquish the Analytics and Reports page.
