{description}

== Values

This application is only available to the user with the xref:ROOT:special-users.adoc#_technical_user[Technical User] credentials. +
It is the tool needed to:

* Bootstrap a Bonita Runtime in Non-Production and Production environments, for example, xref:first-steps-after-setup.adoc#_create_a_bonita_administrator_profile[creating the administrators]
* Ability to notify users about a scheduled maintenance, by a custom message that will be displayed to logged-in users. this message is also displayed on the maintenance page when the maintenance mode is enabled.
* Activate maintenance mode for operations, among which the update of the Business Data Model (and the related database migration)
* Apply temporary fixes to some projects elements (resources, applications, organization entities) to recover from errors

[CAUTION]
====

Most updates at runtime should be performed through a change in the project sources, to create a new project version. +
This new version can then be deployed through Bonita Continuous Delivery. +
This methodology guarantees the consistency between the project sources and the deployed version, making all subsequent changes much simpler and error-proof. +

What the Super Administrator Application allows are emergency changes to recover from an urgent issue. +
All changes performed through this application must be backported to the project sources to be versioned. +
====

== Access during Development and Testing phases

To access the application:

. Open Bonita Studio
. Click on the *Applications* icon of the coolbar.

The default application is the Application Directory. You will be logged in as the default user of the deployed organization. +
This default user can be changed by opening the organization editor. +
By default, in our provided ACME organization, the default user is Walter Bates, logged as "walter.bates", with password "bpm". +

. Log out
. Log back in with the Technical User credentials. In Bonita Studio, use the username: `install` and password `install`.
. In the Application Directory, select _Bonita Super Administrator Application_

You are now logged in Bonita Super Administrator Application.

To access its content:

. From Bonita Super Administrator Application menu, click on "Applications"
. On the "Bonita Super Administrator Application" row, click on the "..." _View application details_ icon


== Status
This application is core to Bonita Platform. It is embedded in the Runtime and cannot be downloaded from Bonita Studio nor be part of your automation project. +
This is the reason why you will not see it in Bonita Studio's Project Explorer. +
It is also the reason why the list of pages is fixed, and no navigation can be created. +

However, it is customizable in quite a few ways, as explained below.

== Customization on Non-Production and Production environments

On the application details page, you will be able to edit:

* the logo
* the layout
* the theme

To update the logo:

. Create the new one. Supported formats/extensions are: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, wbmp, tga. Maximum size: 100 KB
. Click on the "Upload new picture" button below the current logo
. Select the new logo
The new logo is applied.

To update the layout and/or theme:

. Create a new xref:applications:layout-development.adoc[layout] and/or xref:applications:customize-living-application-theme.adoc[theme]
. Go the _Resources_ tab
. Install it
. Go back to the application details
. Click on the current layout or theme
. Select the new one from the drop down list

[NOTE]

Once the Super Administrator Application has been customized, its customized aspects are not supported. +
