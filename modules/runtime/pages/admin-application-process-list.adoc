== Install a new process

This feature is only available for the _Administrator_ profile.

. Go to _BPM_ > _Processes_
. Click on the _Install_ button on the top right of the page
. Click to browse to the .bar file to import
. Click on _Install_

The .bar file is ready to be resolved and/or enabled.

You can only install a .bar file that was exported from a Bonita Studio of the same minor (7.x) version as your Bonita Portal and Bonita Engine. +
If you have a .bar file that was exported from an earlier version of Bonita Studio (7.x-1), it will not work with Bonita Engine. +
Export the process definition as a .bos file from your old Bonita Studio, import in into the new Studio, then export it as a .bar. +
This is necessary for a .bar that has not been deployed. A process that was developed in an older version of Bonita Studio and is already deployed is migrated automatically when you migrate your platform. +
However, for future maintenance of the process definition, you are recommended to update all your process .bar files to the latest version each time you update your platform.

== Resolve a process

Resolving a process means completing the configuration in the Administrator Application and making sure that all dependencies are met. A process has to be resolved before it can be enabled.
To resolve a process, you must complete the configuration of the actor mappings, parameters, forms, and connectors defined for the process.

* *Actors*: Every actor in a process must be mapped to at least one user, group, role or membership.
* *Parameters*: Every parameter defined in a process must have a value.
* *Connectors*: Every connector definition in a process must have a corresponding implementation (Class name).
* *Forms*: Every form defined in a process must be mapped to a page or a URL.
* Also, every business variable used in the process should have a corresponding model.

To resolve a process for actors, parameters, connectors, and forms:

. Go to _BPM_>__Processes__
. On the row of the process, click on _View process details_ icon.
. A summary of configuration problems is displayed below the process name in a well and warning icons are displayed in the left navigation list.
. Modify your configuration for each element displayed.

To resolve a process for business variables:

. Logout
. Login in Bonita Administrator Portal with the xref:ROOT:tenant_admin_credentials.adoc[technical user credentials]
. xref:ROOT:platform-maintenance-mode.adoc[Activate the maintenance mode]
. xref:ROOT:bdm-management-in-bonita-bpm-portal.adoc[Update the BDM]
. End the maintenance mode
. Come back to the application _BPM_/_Processes_ and check the status.

The process moves to the "Enabled" tab.

[NOTE]

You can also enable a process in the "Details" view, by clicking on the _Enable_ button.
====

== Disable a process

Disabling a process blocks the creation of new cases. This does not impact existing cases, where tasks can still be executed.

. Go to _BPM_>__Processes__
. Make sure you are on the "Enabled" tab
. In the row of the process, click on the _Disable_ icon

== Delete a process

[NOTE]
====

A process must be disabled before it can be deleted.
====

[WARNING]
====

*Beware! Data loss risk!*
Deleting a process will automatically delete all its cases (on-going and archived alike). Thus, the operation may take a long time, and fail if the transaction timeout is not large enough.
This feature should only be used on non-production environments.
*Proceed at your own risk.*

The case is started as though the specified user had started it.
For example, if you start a case for user A and a subsequent task is to be done by the manager of the user, it is assigned to user A's manager, not to your manager.
