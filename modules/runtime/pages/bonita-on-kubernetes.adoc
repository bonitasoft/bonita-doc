It is possible to deploy Bonita on Kubernetes, in order to bring together the strengths of both platforms to create an adaptable, resilient infrastructure for managing business processes. 

Let's break down the key aspects:

* Robust: Kubernetes is designed for fault tolerance and self-healing. By deploying Bonita on Kubernetes, you leverage these features, ensuring that your business process management system remains available and operational
* Scalable: one of Kubernetes' core benefits is its ability to scale applications dynamically based on demand
* Efficient: Kubernetes optimizes resource use, which can lead to more efficient operation of Bonita applications
