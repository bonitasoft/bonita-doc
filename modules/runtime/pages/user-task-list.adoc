_Users_ can view lists of tasks assigned to their team, assign a task to themselves, view lists of tasks assigned to them inside a team, work on the tasks, view the "Done" tasks on different processes, and release tasks (depending on their status).

== Overview

Starting with Bonita 7.3, users benefit from a configurable task list, to manage tasks involving human actors from all processes in a more efficient fashion.
This page is also made available as a custom page in Bonita Administrator Application > "Resources" tab, to be used in any xref:ROOT:applications.adoc[application], for any user-type profile.

Here are the values of the user task list:

* Default Master/Detail design pattern, to view list and form in the same screen
* _Panel expand_ feature, to display wide forms in a large modal window

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

* List settings: number of tasks in a page, choice of columns, columns ordering
* Easy access to case information, one tab away from the form. This case information is the case overview page, that the development team can customize
* Easy access to case comments, also one tab away from the form or case information

* Alternate "full width" list, with task information displayed in a large modal window

This list also leverages two legacy features (prior to Bonita 7.3.0):

* xref:ROOT:optimize-user-tasklist.adoc[Dynamic task display name], for efficient task identification (insert business values in task name)
* xref:ROOT:using-list-and-search-methods.adoc]#word_based_search[Word-based search], for efficient task name search (search for any word in the task name)

The task list also contains a _Done tasks_ filter, for the user to check if the task has been completed properly.

[NOTE]
====

Since Bonita 7.3.0, creating subtasks is no longer possible. However, if subtasks have been created in a process instance in an old Bonita version, and if the Bonita Platform has been migrated to a later version while the case was open, then the subtasks will still be visible to the users assigned, and users will still be able to complete them.
