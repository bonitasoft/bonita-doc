Notes:

. Bonita can be executed on Java {minimalRequiredJavaVersion} (see note 1) *only*. All development artifacts (connectors, REST API extensions, etc.) must be compiled with Java {minimalRequiredJavaVersion} byte code (target version). A JRE {minimalRequiredJavaVersion} is required to run Bonita Runtime. A JDK (*not a JRE*) {minimalRequiredJavaVersion} is required to run Bonita Studio.
. Memory usage: In a Studio, by default, the embedded Tomcat server is started with a maximum memory allocation set to 1Go. Depending on your usage you may need to xref:ROOT:bonita-bpm-studio-installation.adoc[increase this value].
. Your database must be configured to use the UTF-8 character set.
. MySQL must be configured to use UTF-8, we recommend using `utf8mb4` because `utf8mb3` is deprecated, see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb3.html[MySQL documentation].
MySQL must be configured with innoDB storage engine.
. Oracle must be configured using AL32UTF8 character set to store properly all _Char_ data
. Check out the requirements for Bonita UI Builder in the xref:applications/ui-builder/faq.adoc[dedicated FAQ]
