image:images/UI2021.1/monitoring.png[Monitoring]

Go to _BPM_> _Monitoring_ for Administrator and _Monitoring_ for Process Manager.
The *Monitor open cases* page is displayed, with the following summary information:

* Number of cases with failure
* Number of healthy cases
* Number of open cases
* A table of open cases

You can filter the table to show only a specified process, or process and version. You can also filter it by process activation state.

Process Managers can see only the processes they manage.

From a row in the table, you can click the _List_ icon to see a list of cases of the process.

You can also open the diagram of a process, by clicking on the _Picture_ icon for the process. On the diagram, you can see the number and state of cases in progress at each step. +
Put your mouse hover any step to see an explanation of the display. +
Zoom in the diagram with either the mouse wheel or the zoom buttons. Once zoomed in, you can drag the diagram. +
Resize your browser window and click on the *_Reset_* button to fit the diagram to your window.

You can customize the diagram page, or embed the BPMN diagram in your own page: see xref:pages-and-forms:customize-display-process-monitoring.adoc[How to customize the display of process execution monitoring].

[NOTE]
====
* If a process was deployed from a .bar fivisualization diagram contains le created in Bonita Studio 6.3 or earlier, the diagram display is not available.
This is because some details of the `.bar` structure have changed. To see the diagram for such a process, export the process definition from Bonita Studio 6.3 as a `.bos` file, import it into Bonita Studio 6.4 or later, generate a new `.bar` file, and deploy it.
* In the process and case diagram of Bonita 2022.2, you may notice the highlight is missing. This, and other values are under development and will be delivered soon.
