Discover how to monitor a runtime environment running Bonita

Monitoring metrics can be published via 3 channels:

* JMX
* Log file
* Prometheus endpoint

== Why monitoring ?

Monitoring a Production environment is crucial to ensure the runtime is correctly sized and tuned, along with detecting abnormal behavior.

Bonita provides a series of technical and Bonita-related metrics to monitor the health of Bonita runtime environment. +
Some metrics are enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Some others are optional and can be enabled according to
your needs.

== Glossary

*Work*: a unitary piece of code that executes parts of process instances, tasks, BPM elements... and allows the processes to move forwards.
It executes in a Java thread.

*Connector work*: a unit piece of code that specifically executes Bonita connectors.

*Work queue*: a queue storing pending works before they are taken by threads for execution.

== What can be monitored?

The runtime uses https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer] to produce and publish *metrics*. *Metrics* are indicators (generally numeric values)
giving information on the system. They can be technical (number of running threads on the JVM), or more Bonita-oriented (total number of connectors executed).


=== Bonita-related metrics

Bonita-related metrics are *enabled by default* and cannot be disabled. Here are the provided metrics:

* The number of currently running works, under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_work_running_works`
* The number of currently pending works, waiting in the work queue to be treated, under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_work_pending_works`
* The total number of executed works (since the last start of Bonita runtime), under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_work_executed_works_total`
* The number of currently running connector works, under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_connector_running_connectors`
* The number of currently pending connector works, waiting in the connector work queue to be treated,
under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_connector_pending_connectors`
* The total number of executed connector works (since the last start of Bonita runtime), under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_connector_executed_connectors_total`
* The total number of BPMN message couples executed (since the last start of Bonita runtime), under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_message_executed_messages_total`
* The total number of BPMN message couples potentially matched (since the last start of Bonita runtime), under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_message_potential_messages_total` (starting from 7.10.3)
* The total number of BPMN message matching tasks retriggered (since the last start of Bonita runtime), under the logical key name `bonita_bpmengine_message_retriggeredtasks_messages_matching_tasks_total` (starting from 7.10.3)



=== Technical metrics

The following available metrics are *disabled by default* and can be enabled.

* Several metrics related to JVM memory, under the logical key names ** jvm.memory.* ** and ** jvm.buffer.* **
* Several metrics related to JVM threads, under the logical key name ** jvm.threads.* **
* Several metrics related to JVM garbage collection, under the logical key name ** jvm.gc.* **
* Several metrics related to Worker / Connector thread pools, under the logical key name ** executor.* **
* Several metrics related to Hibernate statistics, under the logical key name ** hibernate.* **
* Several metrics related to Tomcat, under the logical key name ** tomcat.* **

== How to retrieve those metrics

Those *metrics* are published on *publishers*. *Publishers* are responsible for exposing the activated metrics.
They are channels on which metrics are published. Provided metric publishers are JMX, Log files, Prometheus.

=== JMX Publisher

The JMX publisher publishes each metric using MBeans. All those MBeans are in the domain `metrics`.

It can be enabled using the property `org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.publisher.jmx.enable` set to `true`.

Metrics exposed by the JMX publisher can be consulted by any JMX tool, like the JDK-provided https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/management/using-jconsole.html[JMX Console].

=== Log file Publisher

The log file publisher publishes to a file using the logger `com.bonitasoft.engine.configuration.monitoring.LoggingMeterRegistry`
with the log level `INFO`.

It can be enabled using the property `org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.publisher.logging.enable` set to `true`.

Metrics are logged every `1 minute` by default. It can be changed using the property `org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.logging.step`.


=== Prometheus Publisher

The Prometheus publisher publishes to a REST endpoint in the
https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-format-example[Prometheus format], that can
easily be consumed by Prometheus and then displayed by graphical tools like Grafana, etc.

The endpoint is exposed at:

 http://<SERVER_URL>/bonita/metrics

Use this URL to configure your installed Prometheus configuration in order to record and display the metrics.
The default URL can be changed in the `web.xml` file of the tomcat bundle.

Sample extract of exposed Prometheus data:

 # HELP jvm_buffer_memory_used_bytes An estimate of the memory that the Java virtual machine is using for this buffer pool
 # TYPE jvm_buffer_memory_used_bytes gauge
 jvm_buffer_memory_used_bytes{id="direct",} 565248.0

 # HELP bonita_bpmengine_connector_pending

 ...

This endpoint is protected with Basic access authentication to protect against DOS attacks. +
Thus, when reaching this endpoint, you will have to manually enter the configured username and password information for your access to be granted.

These credentials can be consulted and modified:

* in the <BONITA>/server/conf/tomcat-users.xml file in a *Bonita Tomcat bundle*
* using xref:bonita-docker-installation.adoc#_monitoring_username[specific Environment parameters] when starting a *Bonita Docker image*

== Configuration

Retrieve xref:runtime:bonita-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[current configuration] by running:

[source,bash]
----
./setup/setup.sh pull
----

Edit file `./setup/platform_conf/current/platform_engine/bonita-platform-sp-custom.properties` +

You will see, in the `# MONITORING` section, a series of properties with their default value:

In the first section, `PUBLISHERS` can be activated / deactivated and configured.

 # PUBLISHERS = where to publish?
 # publish metrics to Prometheus
 com.bonitasoft.engine.plugin.monitoring.publisher.prometheus.enable=true
 # publish metrics to JMX:
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.publisher.jmx.enable=true
 # periodically print metrics to logs (bonita related only):
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.publisher.logging.enable=false
 # print to logs every minute by default (ISO-8601 duration):
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.publisher.logging.step=PT1M

In the second section, metrics can be activated.

 # METRICS = what to publish?
 # Note: Bonita-related metrics are automatically published.
 # They are active by default and cannot be disabled.
 #
 # publish technical metrics related to Worker / Connector thread pools:
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.metrics.executors.enable=false
 # publish technical metrics related to HIBERNATE statistics
 # To activate, simply set property (in file 'bonita-platform-community-custom.properties') 'bonita.platform.persistence.generate_statistics=true'
 # publish metrics related to JVM memory:
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.metrics.jvm.memory.enable=false
 # publish metrics related to JVM Threads:
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.metrics.jvm.threads.enable=false
 # publish metrics related to JVM garbage collection:
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.metrics.jvm.gc.enable=false
 # publish technical metrics related to Tomcat (if in a Tomcat context):
 org.bonitasoft.engine.monitoring.metrics.tomcat.enable=false

[NOTE]
====
To change any value, *uncomment the line by removing the # character*, and change the true / false value. +
Then xref:runtime:bonita-platform-setup.adoc#update_platform_conf[push your configuration changes] to database:

[source,bash]
----
./setup/setup.sh push
----

Then restart the Tomcat server for the changes to take effect.
