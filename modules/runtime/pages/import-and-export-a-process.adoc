== Import a process diagram into Bonita Studio

From the Studio's home page:

* From a .bos archive (a diagram from another Bonita studio)

. Choose *_Import a BOS archive_* from the Home Page or click *_Import a project_* in the toolbar.
. Specify the archive to be imported.
. Manage eventual conflicts.
. Click *_Import_*, the .bos archive is imported, a new diagram is created.

From an open Bonita project:

* From a .bos archive (a diagram from another Bonita studio)

. Right-click on the name of your Project and select *_Import a project_*, or click *_Import a project_* in the toolbar.
. Specify the archive to be imported.
. Manage eventual conflicts.
. Click *_Import_*, the .bos archive is imported, a new diagram is created.

* From another format (.xml, .bpmn, .bpmn20)

. Right-click on 'Process Diagram' (located on the left-hand panel) and select *_Import a BPMN 2.0 file_*.
. Specify the file to be imported.
. Click *_Import_*. A new diagram is created.

You can import diagrams that were exported from the following tools:

* Bonita
* BPMN 2.0

=== What is supported or compatible?

A diagram that was exported from the same edition of Bonita, or a lower edition, can be imported successfully.
You cannot import a diagram from a higher edition.
For example, you can import a diagram created with the Community edition into an Enterprise edition Bonita Studio,
but you cannot import a diagram that was created with the Enterprise edition into a Community edition Bonita Studio.

If the format to be imported is BPMN 2.0 compatible, any of the BPMN 2.0 elements displayed in the Bonita Studio *BPMN elements* menu, can be imported successfully. However, if the element to be
imported is *not displayed **in the **BPMN elements* menu, it is not supported by Bonita, so Bonita Studio will _interpret_ the element and create the _closest BPMN element_
that is supported. The following specific changes are made for all import formats:

* If a task in an imported process is *not recognised*, Bonita Studio will create an abstract task for it by default.
* A task format can be *redimensioned* (Height/width) when it is imported.
* If a multiple event is *not recognised*, Bonita Studio takes the first element in order that it can interpret.
* If a gateway is *not supported*, it will be interpreted by default as an AND gateway.
* If there are **multiple pools **in a *.bar file, they will all be imported into a single process diagram.

The following sections list restrictions for specific import formats.

==== BPMN 2.0 (*.bpmn)

Most BPM applications export in the BPMN 2.0 file format. This format is the most suited for Bonita Studio. See http://www.bpmn.org/#tabs-implementers[here] for a list of applications
which export in the .bpmn format.

== Export a process diagram as a BPMN 2.0 archive

If you export a process diagram as a BPMN 2.0 archive you can import it into any BPM application that supports this format, including Bonita Studio.

To export a diagram in BPMN 2.0 format from Bonita Studio:

. Open the diagram.
. Choose *_Export as..._* from the *_Diagram_* menu and select *_BPMN2..._* from the drop-down list.
. Specify the location and filename for the exported diagram, and click *_OK_*.

== Export process elements

You can export files related to elements of the processes in the Bonita Studio project. The files are exported into a .bos archive that can be imported into another Bonita Studio.

You can export the following:

* Application resources
* Business Data Model
* Configurations
* Dependencies
* Diagrams
* Environments
* Organizations
* XSD files

To create a .bos archive:

. Choose *_Export_* from the *_Diagram_* menu or click *_Export_* in the Cool bar.
. Select the items to be exported.
. Specify the filename and location or use the default suggested.
. Click *_Finish_*.

The resulting .bos file can be imported into Bonita Studio.

== Build a process for deployment

When a process is ready for deployment, you must create an executable business archive (.bar file) for deployment.

To create the business archive:

. Choose *_Build..._* from the *_Server_* menu.
. Select the process to be exported.
. Specify whether you want to export a configuration with the process. Exporting a configuration will export all the information and other items that you
configured, including connectors and dependencies.
. Specify the location where the .bar file will be created. The filename is determined by the process name and cannot be changed at this stage.
. Click *_Finish_*. The business archive is created.

== Export a process diagram as an image

This section explains how to export a diagram as an image.

To export a diagram from Bonita Studio:

. Open the diagram.
. Choose *_Export as..._* from the *_Diagram_* menu and select *_Image..._* from the drop-down list.
. Specify the image format and quality.
. Specify the location and filename for the exported diagram, and click *_OK_*.
