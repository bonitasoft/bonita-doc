:description: The Bonita SAP Java Connector 3 allows Bonita to communicate with any SAP system using the SAP JCo 3 toolkit.

{description}

== Prerequisite

You must have an SAP license and an SAP server to use the connector.

=== Overview of the SAP Java Connector (SAP JCo 3) underlying toolkit

* The SAP JCo3 connector can be used to call a SAP function (BAPI, RFC or ZBAPI).
* High-performance JNI-based RFC middleware.
* Supports R/3 3.1H and higher.
* Supports inbound (Java client calls BAPI or RFM) and outbound (ABAP calls Java server) calls.
* Supports synchronous, transactional (important for IDocs), and queued RFC.
* Supports client pooling (good for web servers).
* Has monitoring capabilities.

=== Download and install the SAP connector .zip files

To connect to an SAP system from Bonita Studio, and have the correct graphic display, you must install the SAP .dll and .jar files onto your (Windows) machine. You must have an SAP User ID and password to enter the SAP Support Portal to download the files.
