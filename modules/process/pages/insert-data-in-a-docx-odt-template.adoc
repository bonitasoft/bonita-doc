= Insert data in a .docx/.odt template connector
:page-aliases: ROOT:insert-data-in-a-docx-odt-template.adoc
:description: The *insert data in a .docx/.odt template* fills a specified template file by inserting values coming from the current process instance.
:experimental:

{description}

== Usage

The template is a LibreOffice/OpenOffice `.odt` file or a Microsoft Word``.docx`` file with special placeholders called `keys`. +
A key is a replaceable element in the template that is identified with a dollar sign and surrounded by braces, (eg. $\{element}), following the https://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.7/user-guide.html[Velocity Template Language].

To configure the connector for a task, add a connector (in or out) to the task, choose the "Office" category, and select "insert data in a .dox/odt template".

In the connector configuration, the keys are mapped to variables from the process or from any other data source. +
At some point in the process instance, the template file must be set as the content of a document created at pool level. +
When the connector runs, it creates a file based on the template and inserts the current values of the relevant variables into the appropriate placeholders (keys) in the file. +
The generated file can replace the template in the same document or be stored in another document of the process. A common usage is to send the document by email or store it in an external information system using another connector.

== How to insert `keys` in a template file

=== Using Word (docx)

[NOTE]
====
Tested versions are *Microsoft Word 2007/2010*. This connector may work with later versions.
====

==== Create a `field`

* menu:Insertion[QuickPart > Field...]
* Select FusionField (or MergeField in some Word versions) and use a template (see Velocity templating language) as field name (eg: $\{name}, ${user.Name}...etc)
* Click OK

==== Updating an existing `key`

* Right click on the Fusionfield to edit
* Click on Update field...

=== Using LibreOffice (odt)

* menu:Insert[Fields > More fields...]
* Go to Variables tab, select UserField and use a template (see Velocity templating language) as value (eg: $\{name}, ${user.Name}...etc)
* Choose Text format
* Click Insert +

*Warning:* there is a known issue when adding an image in a .docx using drag'n'drop instead of a copy/paste. The image is not rendered properly if you convert the generated file into PDF.

== Example

This example uses key values taken from a business variable.

=== Business Data Model

// IMPORTANT: links to attachments change in Antora 3.0. See https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/whats-new/#attachment-resource-ids and https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/page/attachments/
Here is a link:{attachmentsdir}/study-leave-template.docx[template example] for Leave Request submission and approval. +
This .docx file uses keys, most of which will be replaced by values from business variables created from the following *Business Data Model*:

image::images/images-6_0/MyUser_Model_lazy.png[]

image::images/images-6_0/Address_Model.png[]

image::images/images-6_0/StudyLeave_Model.png[]

=== Connector configuration

The configuration is as follows:

image::images/images-6_0/document_templating_input_mappings.png[]

In this example, the key named `user` is mapped to the business variable `user`, the key named `leave` is mapped to the business variable `studyLeave`, and the key named `today` is mapped to a groovy script expression with the following content:

[source,groovy]
----
        import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
        new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/dd").format(new Date())
----

* If the keys are mapped with complex objects, pass the high level object to the mapping (eg. *'user'*). The connector will handle the sub-structure of this complex object (eg. *${user.firstName}*)
* When using business variables, relations "loaded when needed" (lazy mode) are not loaded in a connector execution context. To use such relations, create new keys, like "userAddress" in the above example.
* If the replacement value is null, then the field key will be rendered (eg. *${userAddress.line2}*). Use a "!" mark to render blank value, like *$!{userAddress.line2}* if userAddress.line2 may be null.

And the output file mapping:

In this business example, the requesting user enters personal information in a process form. In a subsequent step, the reviewing user adds Approval information. The entered values are then provided as inputs to the *insert data in a .docx/.odt template connector* to replace the keys. +
The generated output file is then stored in a document of the process. +
This connector is built upon *XdocReport* third party library, for more information check their Wiki at https://github.com/opensagres/xdocreport/wiki +

== image:images/troubleshooting.png[troubleshooting-icon] Troubleshooting

*Symptom:* +
You may encounter some delays in the response time while using this connector. +

*Cause:* +
This is due to memory issues as it has substantial size of dependencies. +

*Potential solution:*
You may increase the maximum memory allocation value of the Tomcat server JVM. +

Do do so:
. Go to menu:Preferences[Server settings]
. Increase the Tomcat Maximum memory allocation (`-Xmx` JVM argument) value to *1024* (512 by default). 
Do not forget to use the same value when configuring your Production Bundle.
