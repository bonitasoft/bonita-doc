:description: This page explains how to configure the UiPath connectors in Bonita Studio. UiPath is a global software company that develops a platform for robotic process automation (RPA). +

{description} +
RPA is a complementary technology to BPM that handles high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. RPA technology consists of software robots that mimic a human. Processes can leverage RPA technology when needed to gain efficiency and focus human on added value tasks. https://www.bonitasoft.com/robotic-process-automation[Combining BPM and RPA] allows end to end automation and avoids what is called "islands of automation" by adding the orchestration capacity of a BPM platform to the RPA approach.
