:description: A process diagram is the representation in the Bonita studio of a group of processes (BPMN pools). A process diagram saved, deployed all pools in one action

{description}

A process diagram has a name and a version number. You can xref:diagram-overview.adoc#_changing_the_process_diagram_name_and_version[change the process diagram name and version] whenever you want to indicate a major change in the process diagram. A pool also has a version number that can be updated manually. +
There is no link between the process diagram version and the pool version.

== How to create a new process diagram

To create a new process diagram in Bonita Studio, choose *New* from the Cool bar, or click on the *_Create_* button on the Process Diagram card of the project overview. Give your process diagram a name, and optionally set the version number and add a description. +
You can also turn on or off validation of your process diagram. If validation is on, any errors in your diagram structure are flagged with a red x icon. This helps you correct errors as you build your process diagram, instead of correcting them all at the end.

To open an existing diagram, expand the *Process diagrams* node in the project explorer and double-click on the corresponding process diagram. You can also use the project overview. Click on the *Process diagram* card title to see all the process diagrams of your project. Click on the *Open* button to open the corresponding process diagram.

You can access the process diagram context menu by right-clicking on the corresponding process diagram in the project explorer.
From this context menu you can perform several actions on your process diagram:

* Duplicate
* Rename
* Deploy
* Build
* Run
* Export

== Adding items to a process diagram

There are several ways to add an item to a process diagram:

* Click-and-hold on an icon in the *BPMN elements* menu and drag it to where you want the item in the whiteboard.
* Click-and-release on an icon in the *BPMN elements* then click where you want it to appear in the whiteboard.
* Select the previous item in the flow, and drag the item from the context menu to where you want it in the whiteboard.
* Copy and paste an item from another pool.

The advantage of selecting items from the *BPMN elements* menu is that you can choose precisely the item you want. +
The advantage of using the content menu is that the transition is automatically created.

If you add an icon to the process diagram over a transition, the transition will be broken into two parts and the new item inserted between them. This is called _break-and-insert_, and can be used with any BPMN flow element except text annotations. You can also use _break-and-insert_ when moving an item to a different place in a pool, if the transitions can be resolved.

== Using the tree view and search

The tree view shows all the information that is in a process diagram, arranged in a hierarchical structure. It can be a useful way to see all the information related to a particular step or form, or to find where a specific item is configured. For example, you can see the step where a variable is defined without having to check all the steps.

To find a term in your process diagram, go to the Tree View panel (by default, at the bottom-left of the screen), enter the term in the filter field and press return. +
The tree view is updated to show only the items that match the term.

== Changing the process diagram name and version

Click on the background (outside of a pool) and go to the *Diagram tab* in the *Details panel*. Click on *_Edit..._* then specify the new name and version number. +
You can use the same dialog to change the name and version of any pools in the process diagram.

== Changing the process diagram appearance

You can modify the appearance of an item in the process diagram by selecting it and going to the *Appearance tab* in the *Details panel*. +

In addition to changing the appearance of individual items in the process diagram, there are some tools that you can use to make the layout clearer, by selecting a group of items and making the vertical or horizontal alignment regular. If a process diagram is being developed or maintained by more than one person, it is important to keep the layout clear, to prevent misunderstanding. +

The alignment tools, and others, are accessed from the icons at the bottom-left of the whiteboard.
