= Operations to update variables value
:page-aliases: ROOT:operations.adoc
:description: An operation is an action that updates the value of a variable when a task is executed. You can specify any number of operations per task, they are executed in the order they are listed.

{description}

== Define operations at task level

An operation at task level updates the value of a variable defined for the task or at process level. You can also use an operation at a task to update the value of a search key.

To define an operation at task level:

. Select the relevant task and go to the *Details* panel, *General* tab, *Operations* pane.
. Click *_Add_* to add an operation.
. From the drop-down list, choose the variable to be updated.
. Launch the Expression Editor, by clicking the crayon icon.
. Using the Expression Editor, enter the expression to define the new value of the variable.
If you define the expression with a script, you can use the current value of the variable being updated in the script, so, for example, you can increment a counter. Make sure that the return type matches the type of the variable being updated.

[WARNING]
====

*Important note*: The scripts used in the operations _at task level_ are designed to be read only scripts. It is therefor not recommended to use them to write data to the database.
Ex: In a human task of a process, you add an operation that instantiates a business object with the result of a script. In the script you create and return the business object, and you also decide to update a document by calling a java API method.
While this call _might_ succeed, such a process design is considered bad practice and its behaviour is not garanteed accross Bonita versions
====

You can define a sequence of operations at a task. The operations are performed in the order in which they are listed, at the end of the task. You cannot re-order operations after they are defined, so you need to define the operations in the order they are to be performed.

== Operation types

=== Business object (BO)

* *_takes value of_* : the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand (the BO) using the "=" operator
* _*Java method*_: the left BO is updated with the value from the right operand using an invoked Java method
* _*instantiate with*_: at runtime, when the operator is called, the business data variable points to the selected BO instance if it uses a _Query expression type_. +
 The BO instance must exist in the business data database; otherwise the operator throws an exception. +
 The BO instance is not modified during the operation but from that point onward, any expression or operation in the process can reference this object instance to make changes. +
 If it uses a _Script expression type_, you can use the contract inputs to fill in the BO attributes. +
 Go to xref:data:define-and-deploy-the-bdm.adoc[Initialize BDM attributes from contract inputs in task operations] for more information.
* *_isDeleted_*: an operator 'Is Deleted' can be called on a business data variable. The BO instance that the business data references is deleted from the database, at runtime, after the task is completed.

WARNING: Calling other operations (including _*instantiate with*_) after calling *_isDeleted_* on the same Business Object, in the same task, is not supported. If you want to re instantiate your Business Object, and perform operations on it, you should do it in a separate task.

WARNING: Operations on business objects can be done only at task level.

=== Simple data and List of options

* _*takes value of*_: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the "=" operator

=== Java Object

* _*takes value of*_: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the "=" operator
* _*Java method*_: the left object is updated with the value from the right operand using an invoked Java method

=== XML Object

* _*takes value of*_: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the "=" operator
* _**XPath update **_: the left object is updated with the value from the right operand using an XPath expression

=== Document

* _*set document*_: the value of the right operand document is used to create a new version of the document
