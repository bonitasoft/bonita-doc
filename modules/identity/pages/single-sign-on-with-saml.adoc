= SAML SSO configuration
:page-aliases: ROOT:single-sign-on-with-saml.adoc
:description: Bonita can be configured to use the SAML protocol to provide single sign-on (SSO), as long as you already have a SAML Identity Provider server up and running (IdP).

{description}

[NOTE]
====
For Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions only.
====

This information applies to a Bonita platform deployed from a bundle, not to the Engine launched from Bonita Studio. `<BUNDLE_HOME>` refers to the root directory of the bundle.

SAML configuration is at tenant level. Each tenant can use a different authentication method (over SAML or not).

[NOTE]
====
Bonita uses http://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] as SAML Service Provider adapter.
====

== SAML overview for Bonita

This is an overview that relates the steps required to integrate a bonita bundle with an SAML Identity Provider.

image:images/saml-overview.png[Authentication over SAML]

Here are some details about the Bonita SAML2 module,
it is composed of:

* A servlet filter that intercepts all the requests to Bonita Application pages
+
It checks if the user is already logged in on Bonita

 ** If already logged in \=> Allow the access
 ** If not logged in \=> Redirect to IdP (with user info)

* One Assertion Consumer Service ACS URL (technically this is also handled by the servlet filter through a different URL mapping  `/saml`),
+
This service validates and process the SAML response :

 ** Decode SAMLResponse
 ** Check if the answer is valid (certificate, date, origin)
 ** Extract the username from it (NameId or subject attribute)
 ** Connect to bonita using username
 ** Redirect to the initial requested resource (relayState)

[WARNING]
====
Bonita "username" should match the NameId or one of the attributes returned by the IdP in the response.
 If some users need to be able to log in without having an account on the IDP, you can authorize it by activating an option in the file `authenticationManager-config.properties` (see 2. below). Users will then be able to log in using the Bonita login page (/login.jsp) as long as they have a bonita account and their password is different from their username.
====

== Configure Bonita Bundle for SAML

You need to execute the following actions in the folder of each tenant for which you want to support authentication over SAML.
If you want this configuration to also apply to each tenant created later, make sure to also perform those actions in the _template_ tenant configuration folder:
`<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_*` (if you have not started the Bonita bundle yet, the files are located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_*`)

The bundle already contains the files needed to use SAML with Bonita platform.
To configure Bonita for SAML:

. If you do not already have one:
 .. Download a Subscription edition bundle from the https://customer.bonitasoft.com/[Customer Service Center]
 .. xref:ROOT:tomcat-bundle.adoc[Configure] it as needed
 .. Run it a first time, so that the first default tenant is created (TENANT_ID = 1)
 .. Stop it before modifying the configuration files below
. In the tenant_portal folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal`,
edit the authenticationManager-config.properties as follows:
+
[source,properties]
----
     #auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.standard.StandardAuthenticationManagerImpl
     auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.saml.SAML2AuthenticationManagerImpl
     saml.filter.active = true
     saml.auth.standard.allowed = false
     saml.logout.global = false
     auth.tenant.admin.username = install
     auth.passphrase = BonitaBPM

     #auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.kerberos.RemoteAuthenticationManagerImpl
     # kerberos.filter.active = true
     # kerberos.auth.standard.allowed = false
     # auth.tenant.admin.username = install
 --> auth.tenant.standard.whitelist = william.jobs
     # auth.passphrase = Bonita

     #auth.AuthenticationManager = org.bonitasoft.console.common.server.auth.impl.oauth.OAuthAuthenticationManagerImpl
     # OAuth.serviceProvider = LinkedIn
     # OAuth.consumerKey = ove2vcdjptar
     (...)
     logout.link.hidden=true
----
+

Make sure to xref:ROOT:multi-tenancy-and-tenant-configuration.adoc[set the right tenant admin username].
It is recommended to also replace the value of the passphrase (property auth.passphrase) which is used by the engine to verify the authentication request.
The value must be the same as in the file *bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties*. +
If you need users to be able to log in without having an account on the IDP, you can authorize it by setting the property `saml.auth.standard.allowed` to true. Users will then be able to log in using the Bonita login page (/login.jsp) provided they have a bonita account and their password is different from their username. +
If only a limited group of users need to bypass SAML authentication method, you can restrain it by setting the property `saml.auth.standard.allowed` to false and setting the property `auth.tenant.standard.whitelist` with the list of authorized usernames (comma separated).

. In the tenant_engine folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_engine/`
edit the file bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties as follows:
+
[source,properties]
----
# Authentication service to use. Some are natively provided:
# authenticationService
#   * binded to bonita authentication mode
#   * impl: org.bonitasoft.engine.authentication.impl.AuthenticationServiceImpl
# jaasAuthenticationService
#   * to use JAAS
#   * impl: com.bonitasoft.engine.authentication.impl.JAASGenericAuthenticationServiceImpl
#   * this is the one to configure SSO over CAS (CAS properties to be defined hereafter
# noAuthenticationService
#   * does no authentication on the engine side
#   * impl: com.bonitasoft.engine.authentication.impl.NoAuthenticationServiceImpl
# passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService
#   * Used by SAML2 implementation, login only if a passphrase is valid, or if a username/password is valid.
#   * Requires PassphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService bean to be uncommented in bonita-tenant-sp-custom.xml
#   * impl: com.bonitasoft.engine.authentication.impl.PassphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService
# you can provide your own implementation in bonita-tenant-sp-custom.xml and refer to the bean name of your choice
authentication.service.ref.name=passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService

# If authentication.service.ref.name equals "passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService",
# you need to configure the following passphrase
authentication.service.ref.passphrase=BonitaBPM

# Create users on the fly, when they are missing from bonita but authenticated by the SSO. The user will belong to the group and role specified below.
#authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.enable=true
#authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipGroupPath=/ACME/HR
#authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipRoleName=member

# CAS authentication delegate : enables the user, providing login/password,
# to be logged in automatically against CAS web application
# To be used in conjunction with the generic authentication service configured with CAS (jaasAuthenticationService)
#authenticator.delegate=casAuthenticatorDelegate
#authentication.delegate.cas.server.url.prefix=http://ip_address:port
#authentication.delegate.cas.service.url=http://ip_address:port/bonita/loginservice
----
+
It is recommended to also replace the value of the passphrase (property auth.passphrase). The value must be the same as in the file *authenticationManager-config.properties* updated previously.
+
If you want Bonita engine to create the accounts on the fly once a user accessing Bonita has been authenticated with the IdP, you can uncomment the property `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.enable` (and set its value to true) as well as the next 2 properties to add a default membership to each user account:

 ** `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipGroupPath` specify the group in which every user account created on the fly will be added (the full group path is needed)
 ** `authentication.passphraseOrPasswordAuthenticationService.createMissingUser.defaultMembershipRoleName` specify the role to use to create the membership

+
NOTE: Activating this option means any user authorized by the IdP to access Bonita will have an account created automatically in Bonita Database.

. If your Identity Provider (IdP) requires requests to be signed, generate a private key.
For example on linux, you can use the command ssh-keygen, then go to "`cd ~/.ssh`" to retrieve the key from the file id_rsa (more id_rsa, then copy the key).

+
NOTE: The expected format for Keys and certificates is PEM (with or without the comment header and footer). +

. In the tenant_portal folder of each existing tenant: `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal`, +
edit the file *keycloak-saml.xml* to setup Bonita webapp as a Service provider working with your IdP.
 ** The entityID is the Service Provider given to your Bonita installation. You can change it if you want, but you need to provide it to your IdP.
 ** The sslPolicy option may need to be changed if Bonita Runtime and the IdP are not both accessed via HTTPS. Possible values for this property are: ALL, EXTERNAL, and NONE. For ALL, all requests must come in via HTTPS. For EXTERNAL, only non-private IP addresses must come over via HTTPS. For NONE, no requests are required to come over via HTTPS.
 ** If your *IdP requires the SSO requests to be signed*:
  *** make sure you have signing="true" inside the Key node of the SP
  *** replace the following strings in the Keys:Key section of the SP:
   **** put your private key here
   **** put your certificate here
+
with you current Bonita server's private key and certificate.
  *** make sure you have the following inside the IDP node:
   **** signaturesRequired="true"
   **** signatureAlgorithm="the_algorithm_used_by_your_IDP"  (default value: RSA_SHA256)
  *** make sure you have signRequest="true" inside the SingleSignOnService node
  *** make sure you have the following in the SingleLogoutService node:
   **** signRequest="true"
   **** signResponse="true"
 ** If your *IdP encrypts the assertions*:
  *** make sure you have encryption="true" inside the Key node of the SP
  *** replace the following string in the Keys:Key section of the SP:
   **** put your private key here
+
with you current Bonita server's private key.
 ** If your *IdP responses are signed*:
  *** make sure you have signing="true" inside the Key node of the IDP
  *** replace the following strings in the Keys:Key section of the IDP:
   **** put your certificate here
+
with the certificate provided by the IdP.
  *** make sure you have signatureAlgorithm="the_algorithm_used_by_your_IDP"  (default value: RSA_SHA256) inside the IDP node
  *** make sure you have validateResponseSignature="true" inside the SingleSignOnService node
  *** make sure you have the following in the SingleLogoutService node:
   **** validateRequestSignature="true"
   **** validateResponseSignature="true"
 ** The IDP entityID attribute needs to be replaced with the entity ID of the IdP.
 ** The PrincipalNameMapping policy indicates how to retrieve, in the SAML response from the IdP, the identifier of the subject that matches the bonita user account username.
The policy can either be FROM_NAME_ID or FROM_ATTRIBUTE (in that case you need to specify the name of the attribute to use --only one attribute can be specified--). There can only be one mapping (meaning that the same policy is used for all the user accounts).
 ** You may also need to change the requestBinding and/or responseBinding from POST to REDIRECT depending on your IdP configuration.
 ** The url binding to your IdP also needs to be defined by replacing the following string:
  *** http://idp.saml.binding.url.to.change
 ** If you want to use the SAML logout feature, the URL of your Bonita server needs to be defined by replacing the following string (otherwise, you can remove this attribute):
  *** http://bonita.server.url.to.change


[NOTE]
====

If your you don't have a certificate for your Bonita server, the `CertificatePem` element can be replaced with a `PublicKeyPem` element containing the public key for the Bonita server.
====

[NOTE]
====

About SAML assertions encryption by the IdP: When the assertions encryption is active, the IdP uses a random key which in turn is encrypted with the SP's public key. +
The SP uses its private key to decrypt the random key which in turn is used to decrypt the SAML assertion.
This ensures that only the SP can decrypt the SAML assertion.
====

[NOTE]
====

If your IdP neither requires the SSO requests to be signed nor encrypts its own responses, you can remove the Keys node from the SP and set the attributes signaturesRequired, signRequest and signResponse to false. +
If your IdP responses are not signed, you can remove the Keys node from the IDP and set the attributes validateRequestSignature and validateResponseSignature to false.

Once your Identity Provider is corectly configured (see the section _Configure the Identity Provider_), try to access any Bonita Application page, an app page or a form URL (or just `http://<host>:<port>/bonita[?tenant=<tenantId>]`) and make sure that you are redirected to your Identity Provider to log in (unless you are already logged in). +
Note that if you try to access `http://<bundle host>:<port>/bonita/login.jsp`, then you won't be redirected as this page still needs to be accessible in order for the tenant administrator (or another user if you set the property `saml.auth.standard.allowed` to true) to be able to log in without an account on the Identity Provider.

[WARNING]
====

If your Bonita platform is behind a reverse proxy or a load balancer, You need to make sure the reverse proxy / load balancer is configured
to include the correct headers for the host (and the protocol if needed) to the requests and the application server is configured to use these headers (it is usually the case by default). +
This is required so that `HttpServletRequest.getRequestURL` returns the URL used by the user and not the internal URL used by the reverse proxy. +
For example, if you are running Apache >=2.0.31 as reverse proxy, this configuration is controlled by the property http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost[ProxyPreserveHost] that will override the `Host:` header. +
This can also be achieved by configuring the load balancer / reverse proxy so that it sets the `X-Forwarded-` HTTP headers. For example :
----
    X-Forwarded-Proto: https
    X-Forwarded-Host: your.bonita.external.url.host
----
If you need more fine tuning or if you cannot update the reverse proxy configuration, you can consult the official documentation for https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/common_howto/proxy.html[Tomcat]
====

== Configure the Identity Provider

Your IdP should declare a Service Provider named `bonita` (or the value of the `entityID` set in the file *keycloack-saml.xml* of Bonita bundle if it is different) with the following configuration:

* ACS URL or SAML Processing URL: `http[s]://<bundle host>:<port>/bonita/saml`
* request binding and response binding configured with the same values as in *keycloack-saml.xml* (`POST` or `REDIRECT`)
* `Client signature required` configured with the same values as the property `signRequest` in *keycloack-saml.xml*
* if the IdP requires the client Bonita server (the SP) to sign its requests, make sure the IdP has access to Bonita server's certificate (the same that has been set in the SP:Keys:Key section of the *keycloak-saml.xml*)
* if the IdP responses are signed, make sure the certificate of the IdP has been set in the IDP:Keys:Key section of the *keycloack-saml.xml*
* the Name ID or a user attribute of the user principal sent back by the IdP should match the username of the user accounts in Bonita and the PrincipalNameMapping policy (and attribute value) in *keycloack-saml.xml* should reflect that

[NOTE]
====

If the IdP declares a redirect/target URL, it might override the target URL set by the Service Provider request, and you may always end up on the same page after logging in. In that case, try to remove the redirect URL. Bonita supports redirection to the URL initially requested after logging in on the IdP, provided the IdP doesn't force this URL.
====

== Configure logout behaviour

If your Bonita platform is configured to manage authentication over SAML, when users log out of Bonita Runtime, they do not log out of the SAML Identity Provider (IdP).
Therefore they are not logged out of all applications that are using the IdP.
To avoid this, you have two options :

=== Hide the logout button of the Bonita Layout

This is the most commonly used solution. Users are logged in as long as they don't close their web browser and their session does not time out.
To do this, set the `logout.link.hidden` option to `true` in `authenticationManager-config.properties` located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_portal` for not initialized platform or `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_portal` and `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/[TENANT_ID]/tenant_portal/`.

[NOTE]
====

When a user logs out from the IdP directly, Bonita Runtime's session will remain active. The user's session time to live will be reset
to the configured session timeout value upon each user interaction with the server.
====

=== Setup Bonita platform for SAML global logout

Global logout allows to log out from the Identity Provider as well as all the registered Service Providers when logging out from Bonita platform. This is sometimes required for example if users are on public computers.
As Identity Providers do not necessarily support single logout and have different ways of handling it (there are several SAML Single Logout methods), Bonita only offers SAML global logout as an experimental feature. Meaning that this feature has only been tested with Keycloack server acting as Identity Provider.
Therefore, there is no guaranty that the global logout will work with your Identity Provider. However, if your IdP supports the Service Provider initiated flow of SAML's Web Browser Single Logout profile, single logout is likely to work.
To setup Bonita for global logout:

. Set the `saml.logout.global` option to `true` in `authenticationManager-config.properties` located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_portal` for not initialized platform or `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_portal` and `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal/`.
. Update the SingleLogoutService section of `keycloak-saml.xml` located in `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/initial/tenant_template_portal` for not initialized platform or `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenant_template_portal` and `<BUNDLE_HOME>/setup/platform_conf/current/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/tenant_portal/` to match your Identity Provider configuration and set the property `logoutPage` with he URL of your Bonita server (this is the URL the users will be redirected to once the logout operation succeeded).
. Update your Identity Provider configuration to setup the Logout Service POST/Redirect Binding URL to `<Bonita_server_URL>/bonita/samlLogout?redirect=true`

[NOTE]
====

If the single logout flow supported by your IdP is not the same as the one supported by Bonita platform, the preferred solution to handle it anyway is to intercept the requests to /logoutService and handle the logout programmatically.
====

== image:images/troubleshooting.png[troubleshooting-icon] Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot SSO login issues, you need to increase the xref:ROOT:logging.adoc[log level] to `FINE` for the packages `org.bonitasoft`, `com.bonitasoft`, and `ALL` for `org.keycloak` in order for errors to be displayed in the log files `bonita-*.log` (by default, they are not).

In order to do that in a Tomcat bundle, you need to edit the file `<BUNDLE_HOME>/server/conf/logging.properties.

* Make sure the following lines are not commented or add them if they are not present (the syntaxe of the first line with `class\` is necessary because of the way the loggers are created in Keycloak):

[source,properties]
----
class\ org.keycloak.level = ALL
org.keycloak.level = ALL
----

* Update the existing lines (to set the level to `FINE`):

[source,properties]
----
org.bonitasoft.level = FINE
com.bonitasoft.level = FINE
----

=== Common error examples

== Manage passwords

When your Bonita platform is configured to manage authentication over SAML, the user password are managed in your SAML Identity Provider (IdP).
However, when you create a user in Bonita Applications, specifying a password is mandatory. This password is ignored when logging in with the IdP.

== LDAP synchronizer and SAML

If you are using an LDAP service and the xref:ROOT:ldap-synchronizer.adoc[LDAP synchronizer] to manage your user data, +
you can continue to do this and manage authentication over SAML. +
The LDAP synchronizer user must be registered in Bonita (no need for an SAML IdP account). It is recommended though to use the tenant admin account.
We recommend that you use LDAP as your master source for information, synchronizing the relevant information with your Bonita platform.

[NOTE]
====

By default the xref:ROOT:ldap-synchronizer.adoc[LDAP synchronizer] sets the password of the accounts created with the same value as the username. So, even if you allow standard authentication (by setting the property `saml.auth.standard.allowed` in *authenticationManager-config.properties*), users won't be able to log in with the Bonita login page directly without going through the IdP. +
====

== Single sign-on with SAML using the REST API

SAML is a browser-oriented protocol (based on http automatic redirection, forms, etc...), therefore only resources that require a direct access from a web browser are handled by the SAML filter.
Access to other resources won't trigger an SAML authentication process.
Here is the subset of pages filtered by the SAML filter:

* /saml
* /samlLogout
* /portal/homepage
* /portal/resource/*
* /portal/form/*
* /mobile/*
* /apps/*
* /logoutservice

REST API are not part of them, but if an http session already exists thanks to cookies, REST API can be used.

The recommended way to authenticate in Bonita Runtime, in order to use the REST API, is to use the xref:ROOT:rest-api-overview.adoc#bonita-authentication[login service].
