Depending on your underlying authentication service, you may need to provide other information with the API in order to log in. A login method with a map enables you to provide the set of credentials that the authentication service requires.
The following example can be used if you are xref:ROOT:single-sign-on-with-cas.adoc[using Bonita with CAS]:

[source,java]
----
final LoginAPI loginAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getLoginAPI();
final Map<String, Serializable> credentials = new HashMap<String, Serializable>();
credentials.put(AuthenticationConstants.CAS_TICKET, ticket);
APISession session = loginAPI.login(credentials);
ProcessAPI processAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getProcessAPI(session);
